<h2><a name="summerschool">2. 2nd ESSA Summer School on Agent-Based Modelling</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.simian.ac.uk/courses/essa-summer-school-2011">second ESSA Summer School on Agent-Based Modelling</a> was held a few weeks ago on 18-22 July. Many thanks for Nigel Gilbert, Lu Yang and the others for organizing such an amazing event for us!
The school was held in Guildford, at the <a href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/">University of Surrey</a> which was a beautiful place to visit during the guided and boat trips we had.</p>

<p>The lectures covered the full lifecycle of modelling that a new researcher should be aware of, from questions like why, when and how (not) to use simulations (Bruce Edmons), how to refine the research topic and what rules should we keep in mind during the research to avoid common pitfalls (Edmund Chattoe-Brown), and how participatory simulations may help our work (Flaminio Squazzoni). We were shown several case studies for both prediction or validation, like how to apply the agent-based framework for the interbank payment system (Pietro Terna) or predicting volatile markets like the fruit juice market of Switzerland (Abhijit Sengupta), but we also got general strategies and advices like what to keep in mind for policy modelling and how declarative tools may help us in the subject (Klaus G. Troitzsch). We also got a lot of fundamental advices regarding to modelling through a set of practical examples that people have paid money for (Paul Ormerod), or how to use design of experiments to perform the simulations in a proper way, and how to extract hidden information from the raw output data (Iris Lorscheid and Warren Thorngate).</p>

<p>Special thanks to David Hales, who made great effort to record and edit all of the lectures and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/daphal">made them available</a> with video interviews. If you missed the event but interested what we learnt there, you will find these materials especially useful! Also thanks to <a href="http://www.simian.ac.uk/courses/essa-summer-school-2011/delegates">the delegates</a> for all the interesting discussions and valuable advices during the group meetings. It was a really fruitful week.</p>

<p>The Summer school was sponsored by the SIMIAN project, Unilever plc, ASSYST and the University of Surrey, to whom we are grateful for their support.</p>
