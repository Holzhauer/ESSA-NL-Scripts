On one hand these encounters can be useful for bringing cultures closer, but also have the potential of causing unfortunate misunderstandings, which can escalate to all out conflicts.  Hofstede defines culture as “forms of things in mind and their mental models of perceiving and interpreting them”, Virtual characters can be used to enhance cultural understanding by making them culturally aware, In order to do this we can promote cultural influence to cognitive processes of perception, planning and the ability to react in a virtual world. In doing so the relationship between emotions and cultures is of significant importance. Theories related to emotional modulation, cultural differences and personality become the basis of modelling such virtual characters. This gives rise to number of issues to be looked at, e.g. how to model intelligent virtual characters so that they are culturally aware, making the interaction with these characters culturally motivated and to evaluate  what are the effects of using cultures in virtual characters.",http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/cmvc/,Richard,,,218,,

Ontology engineers are not supposed to succeed right from the beginning when (individually or collaboratively) developing and maintaining an ontology.

We consider complex systems composed from a large number of components (agents) capable
to make specialized computations in the problem space. Such developments are usually composed of a very large number of computational components, who interact many times nonlinearly, forming as a whole a complex problem solving system. A subclass of complex systems includes the hybrid systems
composed from different type of artificial components capable to make computations, and human specialists that could interact in different points of decisions during the problems solving.
Research related to complex systems address analysis of many aspects such as complexity, self-organization, emergence, intelligence, hybridization and so forth. Many computational complex  systems developments require interdisciplinary approaches, which must include methods developed in different sciences, like sub-domains of the Artificial Intelligence like Natural Computing and
Intelligent Agents.",http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/titledetails.aspx?TitleId=1100,Richard,,,218,,

The notion of social conflict entails a broad range of phenomena, such as latent confrontation as well as manifest war. Its scope ranges from inter-individual to international relations. Viewed in this broad sense, conflicts are an essential and inevitable component of social relationships. A scientific comprehension of these various dimensions of social conflicts includes disciplinary accounts ranging from social psychology to the theory of international relations. To bring together scholars working in these various dimensions of Social Conflict and Social Simulation, we invite authors from all backgrounds to submit papers for a SIG-SCSS panel at the ESSA 2011 conference.

Viewed in this broad sense, conflicts are an essential and inevitable component of social relationships. A scientific comprehension of these various dimensions of social conflicts includes disciplinary accounts ranging from social psychology to the theory of international relations. To bring together scholars working in these various dimensions of Social Conflict and Social Simulation, we invite authors from all backgrounds to submit papers for a SIG-SCSS panel at the ESSA 2011 conference.

SOC-MAS'11 provides a premier forum for researchers and engineers alike in both communities to present state-of-the-art research and development progresses in all areas related to architectures, design, implementation, applications and evaluation of service-oriented computing and multi-agent systems with emphasis on the interplay between the two.

Social networks provide a powerful abstraction of the structure and dynamics of diverse kinds of people or people-to-technology interaction. These social network systems are usually characterized by the complex network structures and rich accompanying contextual information. Recent trends also indicate the usage of complex network as a key feature for next generation usage and exploitation of the Web. This journal is focused on the foundations of social networks as well as case studies, empirical, and other methodological works related to the computational tools for the automatic discovery of Web-based social networks. This Journal provides an opportunity to compare and contrast the ethological approach to social behaviour in animals (including the study of animal tracks and learning by members of the same species) with web-based evidence of social interaction, perceptual learning, information granulation, the behaviour of humans and affinities between web-based social networks. The main topics cover the design and use of various computational intelligence tools and software, simulations of social networks, representation and analysis of social networks, use of semantic networks in the design and community-based research issues such as knowledge discovery, privacy and protection, and visualization.

In particular, inputs addressing the following questions are invited:
- How resilient is the global, regional or national energy systems to future changes in the availability of fossil fuel reserves?
- How sensitive is the global, regional or national energy security to investment (or lack of investment) in renewable energy infrastructure, including transmission, distribution and storage?
- Are current diffusion curves of renewable technologies adequate for the transition to low-carbon and sustainable energy systems?
- What impact could increased levels of electrification of the transport sector have on energy security?
- How exposed are the current national energy supply systems to international events such as conflicts in MENA?

Although the literature about value-free science is huge, the specific theme of values and norms exclusively focusing on modeling has not yet received the attention it should. Models are often conceived of as being approximate representations with epistemic or even non-epistemic purposes, which makes them subject to a plethora of normative influences. We are interested in questions such as: How do epistemic and non-epistemic values affect the production and assessment of models? What is the moral significance of these values and norms? To what extent, if any, does the allowance of value assessments threaten the objectivity of models? Would it be desirable, and possible, to eliminate epistemic or non-epistemic values and norms from models?  We invite papers addressing these and related issues from a foundational as well as an applied perspective. We especially welcome contributions on non-epistemic values in engineering modeling, climate modeling and modeling in operations research.",vanim2012@easychair.org,Richard,,AISB,229,,

Simulation engineering (i.e. the tasks concerning the definition of a simulation model and its software implementation) is often a central activity to support the design of software and hardware systems. As simulation systems are mainly based on software, these systems can similarly benefit from model-driven approaches to automate software generation, enhance software quality, and reduce costs, development effort and time-to-market.

Fundamental to the notion of what it is to be human, and alongside ideas about intelligence and autonomy, are questions about what it is to be creative. Issues of ""computational creativity"" therefore lie at the heart of the intersection of A.I., Cognitive Science, Philosophy, and the Arts.
An autonomous system is typically considered to be a self-determining system, as distinguished from a system whose behaviour is explicitly externally engineered. The concept of autonomy (and autonomous systems) is therefore central to understanding both intelligent and cognitive systems. In the area of robotics, for instance, issues of embodiment and autonomy are core to the practise of A.I. and,
 in the development of enactivism and emergence, conceptually central to a modern understanding of cognition (an area recently explored by Evan Thompson is his 2007 monograph, 'Mind in Life'). Indeed, some commentators such as Maturana and Varela - in their seminal work on autopoiesis and cognition - go so far as to suggest autonomy a necessary hurdle over which any 'living machine'
with a claim to genuine teleology must leap.",http://www.springer.com/biomed/neuroscience/journal/12559,Richard,,SSAISB,230,"Special issue on Computational Intelligence, Creativity and Autonomy",

Such systems are characterized by non-linearities and feedbacks: even a small change in one component can cause sudden abrupt change at the system level. Shocks in environmental systems include regime shift as a result of gradual ecosystem degradation, and natural hazards such as floods or droughts, chances of which increase significantly with climate change. Shocks in socio-economic systems comprise such phenomena as economic crises or social unrest. Abrupt shocks either in the ecological or socio-economic subsystem may disturb the whole structure of the coupled system altering the flow and strength of the feedbacks. At the same time complex socio-ecological systems are constantly adapting to changes and evolving over time, so the consequences of the abrupt changes either in ecological or socio-economic subsystems for the adaptive dynamics of coupled system are not immediately obvious. Models that can help exploring, studying and predicting the responses of coupled socio-ecological systems to shocks are consequently in demand. This session aims to bring together scholars using formal (i.e. mathematical or computational) models to study responses to shocks in complex socio-ecological systems. 
The range of questions this session focuses on includes: 
- Case studies of analysis of shocks to socio-ecological systems in the past
- Predictions from scenarios of shocks to contemporary socio-ecological systems
- Abstract models studying shocks to coupled social and environmental systems
- Models of adaptive individual behavior and/or structural behavioral changes in response to environmental shocks, with a special focus on changes due to changing climate

Consequently, quite different aspects are considered, e.g. uncertainty and attitudes towards risk, past experiences, behaviour of other agents, limited availability of information (bounded rationality, heuristic decision making) and alternative income possibilities.

But to date it is unclear how REDD+ mechanisms can best deliver beneficial outcomes with regard to understanding and monitoring the impact on climate effectiveness, cost efficiency, equity and co-benefits. Knowledge of the decision-making processes that lead to changes in land use is prerequisite to understand the likely impacts of REDD+ payments on the drivers of forest carbon emissions and to provide reasonable estimates of future emission levels. Modelling approaches can generate a better understanding of land-use decision making and provide crucial insights into the setting of historic and future baselines, the monitoring of leakage, the verification of additionality, and the assessment of likely co-benefits of REDD+.

New sources of social network data such as Twitter, Facebook, OpenCongress, CrunchBase, and many others, present data at the scale up to 100s of millions of nodes and billions of edges, with millions of nodes and edges added every hour. In this environment, traditional SNA algorithms and metrics falter due to their high computational complexity and difficulty of parallelization. Big Data approaches such as Map/Reduce, Hive, Pig and Storm, distributed data storage solutions of Hadoop, Redis and MongoDB hold a promise that SNA algorithms can be made to work over web-scale data — but much work is required to make this happen. We are soliciting papers, demos and tutorials on:
- Software — open-source or academic-license tools
- Big Social Data problems, solutions and war stories
- Data warehousing, data manipulation, data wrangling and wrestling
- Streaming graph analysis, real-time data analysis, dynamic network analysis
- Real-world applications
- … any topic relevant to analysis of big, real-time, social network and social stream data

Part 1 of the workshop shall be devoted to practical aspects of dealing with big data — perhaps more of a tutorial to get everyone up to speed. We’ll select practical papers for this section.
Part 2 will be in a Hackathon format — we will start by setting up a distributed, real-time cloud computing “playground”, turn on a fast and high-volume data stream, and, at the end of the workshop, leave with meaningful adaptations of SNA metrics and algorithms to real-time, high-volume data. We will encourage formation of impromptu teams and collaborations, especially joint work involving academics and industry.
Part 3 — The Red-Eye session — will be devoted to presentations of the hackathon participants and academic and industry “war stories”.
Hackathon attendees are expected to be proficient programmers in languages of their choice, and bring high-performance laptops to the workshop. They’ll need all the computing horsepower they can get. We’ll also provide generic Amazon EC2 instances for cloud computing

Complexity scholars study complex configurations of multitudes of elements in overlapping, interdependent and interlocking patterns of relationships. This entails a diverse range of emerging conflicts, the generating processes and underlying mechanisms of which are not yet fully explored let alone understood. However, the past decade has faced a growing interest in modeling and simulation applications to peace and security and related implications of systemic complexity. Methodological improvements in modeling and simulation add to the advances made in and the growth of the field of peace and conflict research. This is also reflected by the fact that relevant publications are no longer restricted to outlets reserved for modeling and simulation. In this sense the panel on peace and conflict simulation aims at providing a platform to present current research and share insight about the latest methodological developments.  We particularly welcome submissions that report on empirical conflict and peace modeling and simulation. Interested scholars of all fields with an interest in modeling and simulation are cordially invited to join this event and to submit papers to the panel of the WCS.
Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to: Complexity and peace and  conflict research, Networks and peace and  conflict research, Conflict and the environmental change, Crowd behavior and control, Armed conflicts and regime transformation, International conflicts, Internal conflict, civil war and insurgencies, Ethnic and religious conflict, Terrorism, Organized crime, Conflict mediation, mitigation and resolution.",http://wintersim.org/,Sascha,"Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling",mneumann@soziologie.rwth-aachen.de,242,,

Multiagent modeling made a significant contribution to this tradition - and more is to come. However, multiagent modeling and simulation of social conflict has also drawn critique, not least from theorists and practitioners. We believe it is time to lean back for a moment and think about what it is we want to get from modeling and simulating social conflict and how we can further this cause. While innovation is rarely driven by round tables - rather by doing the work - we hope the event will lead to the formulation of (new) research foci, opportunities for collaboration, and ethical guidelines.
Participants interested in the topic of social simulation and social conflicts are invited to submit a statement paper of 1 to 2 pages that provides a basis for a short and stimulating presentation at the round table. Statements may cover the following topics:
- What fields of conflict research may benefit from simulation accounts? 
- Conversely, what should not be subject of simulation accounts?
- How and why is complexity a source of conflicts? 
- What is the contribution of simulation to the dissection of social mechanisms?
- What is the contribution of simulation to the analysis of disaggregated data

On the one hand, if the puzzle is theoretical, simulation can be used to deductively explore all the outcomes logically associated with a given set of mechanisms. In this case, the comparison to empirical data is not necessary. On the other hand, we expect paper proposals dealing with clearly defined macroscopic empirical data in quest of explanation. In this case, the focus of the paper should be the way empirical data and the simulated model interact with each other. In this respect, we invite paper proposals focusing on (one/several of) the following aspects: 1. the relationships between agent-based modelling and multivariate statistical techniques; 2. the relationships between agent-based modelling and qualitative/ethnographic data; 3. the relationships between agent-based modelling and experimental data; 4. the relationships between agent-based modelling and techniques of social network analysis.",http://www.rfs-revue.com/spip.php%3Flang=en.html,Sascha,Agent-Based Modelling,,245,Revue Française de Sociologie,

The ultimate goal of Social Informatics is to create better understanding of socially-centric platforms not just as a technology, but also as a set of social phenomena. To that end, we are inviting interdisciplinary papers, on applying information technology in the study of social phenomena, on applying social concepts in the design of information systems, on applying methods from the social sciences in the study of social computing and information systems, on applying computational algorithms to facilitate the study of social systems and human social dynamics, and on designing information and communication technologies that consider social context.
A special focus of SocInfo'2012 is on how technology can influence social phenomena through better motivation of human agents, through the use of social norms, through better modeling, or through a better understanding of social concepts like trust, credibility, privacy, and fairness. To this end we are especially inviting contributions demonstrating how behavioral theory can be formalized in agent-based models to study social dynamics. It is the expectation that this contributes to a further development of the social sciences with respect to studying and explaining various behavioral dynamics, such as opinion dynamics, social conflict, innovation diffusion, market dynamics, and crowd behavior. On the other hand, the creation of a coherent social behavioral model that is formulated as an agent system is a prerequisite for further development of socially-centric platforms and for the testing of new algorithms that use social concepts and attempt to realize social goals.",http://socinfo2012.com/,Richard,,,246,,

The report goes on to say ""epidemiological estimates have shifted over time because of changes in the definitions and diagnosis of mental health and mental illness."" Indeed, some experts believe there has been an astonishing rise in mental illness. According to one report: ""In 1987, prior to Prozac hitting the market and the current ubiquitous use of antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs, the U.S. mental illness disability rate was 1 in every 184 Americans, but by 2007 the mental illness disability rate had more than doubled to 1 in every 76 Americans.""

And what are the roles of economics and the pharmaceutical industry in this controversy? At the core of what is going on with mental illness in America and around the world, we believe, is cultural sociology: How differing cultures treat mental illness and, in turn, how mental patients are affected by the culture. In this multidisciplinary reference, we look at the culture of mental illness in non-clinical perspectives of sociology, history, psychology, epidemiology, economics, public policy, health practitioners, and finally the mental health patient him or herself.

premises:

* The growth of new advanced distributed computing standards along
   with the rapid rise of e-commerce are providing a new context that
   acts as a critical driver for the development of next generation
   systems. These standards revolve around service-oriented
   technologies, pervasive computing, web-services, Grid, autonomic
   computing, ambient intelligence etc. The supporting role that
   intelligent agents play in the development of such systems is
   becoming pervasive, and simulation plays a critical role in the
   analysis and design of such systems.

* The use of emergent agent technologies at the organization,
   interaction (e.g., coordination, negotiation, communication) and
   agent levels (i.e. reasoning, autonomy) are expected to advance
   the state of the art in various application technologies is
   difficult. Using agent-supported simulation techniques for
   testing complex agent systems is up and coming field.
* To facilitate bridging the gap between research and application,
   there is a need for tools, agent programming languages, and
   methodologies to analyze, design, and implement complex,
   non-trivial agent-based simulations. Existing agent-based
   simulation tools are still not mature enough to enable developing
   agents with varying degrees cognitive and reasoning capabilities.",http://www.scs.org/node/344,Richard,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Market Dynamics, Policy Making, Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Societal Transitions, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics, Methods in General, Game Theory, Complex Systems, Social Networks",repast-interest,258,"All prospective authors, whose papers are accepted for inclusion in the  program, will be invited to submit their position or technical papers to  ADS'13.

Vice versa, in the social sciences - sociology, philosophy, economics, legal science, etc. - computational models and their implementations have been used to investigate the rigour of theories and hypothesis.

The use of these social science concepts in computer science is sometimes on a more metaphorical level than a detailed implementation of the ""real"" concept and the theories surrounding it. Equally, the computer models used in the social sciences  are not always convincing.

After a history of around 30 years of agents in computer science, the meeting of these two worlds is long overdue. Building upon the two previous AISB symposia on normative multi-agent systems (2005 and 2010) as well as the ones on social networks (2009 and 2010) and social simulation (2012), this symposium aims to provide a productive meeting ground for these disciplines.

Research from different domains, at the crossing of various disciplines – economics, psychology, sociology, computer sciences, engineering, physics - are useful for developing more satisfactory approaches to (macro) econometrics and (macro) economic theory.

These approaches have already brought some improvement in the understanding of problems facing the world economy, such as the financial crisis, segregation, unemployment and poverty, and the need for sustainable development.

The workshop aims to make progress in understanding and solving them.

This track aims to bring together sociologists doing experimental and computational research on social interaction to examine the complexity of micro-macro processes in the economy and the society. While this type of research has gained momentum in behavioural and social sciences in the last decades, this is still a marginal endeavour in sociology. This track aims to provide a forum to these innovative studies in our discipline. 

Priority will be given to empirically-grounded models, attempts to integrate experimental and computational methods and examples of mixed method research (also combining experiments and simulation with empirical data).

Topics of interest include but are not limited to: social norms and market behaviour, trust and reputation models, social networks, social influence models, game theory and cooperation, coordination, and collaboration problems, social and cultural dynamics, political behaviour, complex organizational behaviour and dynamics.

Experimental research has been largely encouraged by this approach and common theoretical perspectives have been shared in different disciplines of human behaviour and decision making. At the same time the concept of rationality has evolved in order to adhere to actual decisions of individual people, groups and collective behaviour. Models of rational actor have become softer and more complex. Relations between instrumental rationality and sentiments, selfishness and altruism, game theoretic assumption and cultural conditions have been experimentally checked, often bringing counter intuitive and even paradoxical results.
The aim of the conference is that of making scholars of both disciplines meet and discuss their approaches with the idea that a comparison between sociology and political science on the advancement of cutting g edge research activities can open new perspectives, suggest future research and be of mutual benefit for both.

Several frameworks have been recently developed and are active in this field. They range from the GPU-Manycore approach, to Parallel, to Distributed simulation environments. In the first category, you can find FLAME GPU, that allows also non GPU specialists to harness the GPUs performance for real time simulation and visualization. For tightly-coupled, large computing clusters and supercomputers a very popular framework is Repast for High Performance Computing (REPAST-HPC), a C++-based modeling system. On the distributed side, recent work on Distributed Mason, allows non specialists to use heterogeneous hardware and software in local area networks for enlarging the size and speeding up the simulation of complex Agent-Based models.

Motivating Sustainable Consumption - a review of evidence on consumer behaviour and behavioural change. Sustainable Development Research Network, p. iii).

Changing consumer behaviour is key to moving towards low carbon energy systems. It is therefore important to understand how to shape behaviour in line with new environmental policies. To date, many theories of consumer behaviour neglect the social embedding of consumers and their habits, as well as the availability of technologies, and are therefore insufficient to account for behavioural change. In recent years social practice theory has received attention as a promising approach for the study of consumption as it is able to address some of the shortcomings of traditional theories. A new way of approaching these issues is to develop computational models of social practices.  Such models might be especially helpful in illuminating the mechanisms underlying the emergence and diffusion of social practices.

We invite contributions from all research disciplines that:

- describe computational models that have been inspired by social practice theory, or
- present theories of household energy demand in computational form, or
- examine the value of quantitative or qualitative models of social energy-related practices.

The workshop aims to provide a meeting point for researchers interested in social (energy) practices with the aim of facilitating future interactions and research. There will therefore be ample time for discussion as well as for presentations.",http://goo.gl/azrnPh,Richard,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics, Methods in General, Complex Systems",agents-request,265,,

 PANELS: Panels are a great way to generate debate and raise new and interesting issues at CSCW. With panels we want to provide a forum for discussing provocative, controversial, innovative, emerging, boundary-spanning and boundary-breaking issues. While paper sessions provide detailed discussions of work recently completed, panels provide an opportunity to explore what is on the horizon — or what is already here but not adequately recognized, acknowledged or discussed. The best panels provide opportunities for audience participation. We especially encourage innovative formats that will address relevant, critical and contemporary topics, engage the audience and provoke discussion and engage multiple disciplines in productive dialog.

DEMOS: CSCW 2014 demonstrations present implementations of new CSCW systems and concepts. The peer-reviewed demonstrations allow conference participants to view novel and noteworthy CSCW systems in action, discuss the systems with those who created them, and try them out. Appropriate demonstrations include applications, technologies, and research prototypes, and may showcase work that has been or is being published at CSCW or elsewhere. Demonstrations can also serve to showcase novel commercial products not previously described in the research literature. Demonstrations should be interactive and provide attendees a hands-on experience. The demo forum is not an opportunity for marketing or sales presentations.

Engineering methods are still not commonly used when developing Agent-Based Social Simulations (ABSS). With this special section we aim to create a review of the current state of the art in using SE methods in ABSS. We will prioritise papers that are based on real experience, preferably including some kind of evaluation of the success of the methods/tools used.

These standards revolve around service-oriented technologies, pervasive computing, web-services, Grid, autonomic computing, ambient intelligence etc. The supporting role that intelligent agents play in the development of such systems is becoming pervasive, and simulation plays a critical role in the analysis and design of such systems.
- The use of emergent agent technologies at the organization, interaction (e.g., coordination, negotiation, communication) and agent levels (i.e. reasoning, autonomy) are expected to advance the state of the art in various application technologies is difficult. Using agent-supported simulation techniques for testing complex agent systems is up and coming field.
- To facilitate bridging the gap between research and application, there is a need for tools, agent programming languages, and methodologies to analyze, design, and implement complex, non-trivial agent-based simulations.

“Social Simulation in Environmental Psychology”
Social simulation has been one of the most interesting methodological developments of the last decades for the behavioral sciences. Social simulation models deal with behavioral and cognitive dynamics, with differentiated social influence, with feedback to (simulated) natural environments, or space. Specifically in environmental psychology, these models can also stimulate collaborations between environmental psychologists and researchers from other disciplines to deal with complex environmental problems. 
The goal of this special issue is to provide successful examples of social simulation from the domain of environmental psychology. We encourage the submission of papers with a focus on psychological or behavioral theory in their agent architecture. We strongly prefer empirical data as the basis for the parameterization or the validation of the model. Papers must address a relevant environmental domain.
We invite pre-submissions of 2-page paper proposals from which we will invite full paper submissions. This paper proposal should be submitted directly to the guest editors for this special issue (e-mail addresses below). Full paper submissions will be assessed through the EES website, and will be peer-reviewed. Full papers should follow JEP’s style guidelines, which basically is APA style. 
Accepted papers will be offered the possibility of including video material to demonstrate typical simulation runs. If you supply video and animation files, they will be published online in the electronic version of your article in Elsevier Web products, including ScienceDirect. The models presented in the papers should be made available on OpenABM (www.openabm.org). Also see the guide for authors at: http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-environmental-psychology/.

7/1/2014 22:08:23,"Call for book chapter proposals: ""Social Systems Engineering: The Design of Complexity""",,11/1/2014,N/A,,11/1/2014,,"Summary: This book will constitute a collection of chapters that will reflect a design approach to social systems applied to diverse contexts. This book will highlight an “engineering” view to social systems (as opposed to a “scientific” view), thus stressing the significance and complexity of systems design for specific and singular settings, the use of computational models in particular contexts, and the development of portfolios of solutions. A distinctive feature of the book will be to emphasise, from the beginning, the Simonian “sciences of the artificial” as a paradigm for coping with social systems. The purpose of the book is to highlight works wherein the design, the re-design and the transformation of social systems constitute the main aim. We invite contributions that address transformation and design (and the relevance of both) in any aspect of social systems.
