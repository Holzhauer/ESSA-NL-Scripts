Indeed, this type of issues have attracted increasing attention in the economics literature, and the use of ABMs for their study can complement or extend the existing findings, which are largely based on analytically tractable models.",The scholarship will provide an annual stipend of £15000 (for 3 years) and a contribution towards the cost of the tuition fee over 3 years.,"Informal project related enquiries may be directed to Professor Giulia Iori  email g.iori@city.ac.uk

A demonstrated interest in biology is a definite advantage. Applications are invited from UK home students and EU citizens.","This PhD will investigate links between neuroscience, social insect collective behaviour, and decision theory. Theories of optimal decision-making have successfully been applied to individual-level decisions, both in explaining data from experimental subjects, and in analysing the optimal performance of neurobiologically realistic models. A key feature of many such models is that sensory evidence is compared against some internal threshold in determining what choice to make [...]. Decision confidence has proved to be useful in understanding behaviour and neural activity in individuals. At the same time, recent complementary work has applied optimality theory developed for neural models to the collective behaviour of social insects, such as ants and honeybees, when searching for a new potential nest site. There are many similarities between the interaction patterns of social insect colonies, and neural populations in the brain. The proposed PhD project will further extend these analogies, by examining the potential role of individual and collective decision-confidence in models of house-hunting by ant and honeybee colonies.",Fees and a stipend will be paid for the duration of the studentship.,"Apply online or contact Dr Marshall if you require further information: http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/J.Marshall/, J.Marshall@dcs.shef.ac.uk, (+44) 114 22 21832",http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/J.Marshall/lab/About_Us.html,2012-02-27,"Mathematical, Computer science, Biology",Sascha,,PhD student position,233,

4/27/2012 12:22:04,Understanding sustainability transitions through agent-based modelling,"Bournemouth, UK",Bournemouth University,,"This research will consider human society as a complex adaptive system composed of agents (either individual people or organisations), which interact locally in time and space. Such systems display macroscopic behaviours, which emerge from local interactions between agents. While the dynamics of such systems are often unpredictable and uncertain, they may display emergent properties, such as a collective shift in behaviour (Levin 2010). We propose that a sustainability transition at the societal level represents such a shift or “tipping point”. Understanding how a sustainability transition might be achieved therefore depends on understanding the interactions between agents, which influence their decision-making.
On the basis of current theory (Gladwell 2010, Levin 2010), we propose that human decision-making is primarily influenced by the values and actions of an immediate peer group, such as the social contacts of an individual, or the competitors of a business. We aim to test this hypothesis using a novel iterative approach, employing experimentation and agent-based modelling. We propose to construct a dummy social network internet site, to provide a virtual laboratory, within which we will explore the factors influencing individual decision-making. This will enable us to manipulate the values and actions of a virtual peer group, and observe the impacts on decision-making by experimental subjects. We will use the results to simulate the emergent behaviour of a community of people, using agent-based modelling approaches, which will guide the design of further experimentation.[...]",,Prof A Newton,http://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=38381&LID=156,2012-05-31,"Societal Transitions, Agent-Based Modelling, Complex Systems",Sascha,,PhD student position,245,

Opportunities are available for project personnel at all levels:  undergraduate, master’s, PhD, and post-doctoral fellow.  
Municipalities throughout Canada are challenged to make planning decisions to enhance economic competitiveness, the urban environment, and residents’ quality of life. Commonly applied planning interventions influence location incentives, including the diversity and spatial distribution of housing provided by the development community.  Location decisions are also influenced by the location, cost, and connectedness of transport networks. The distribution of activities in turn, dictates the transportation behavior of travelers. Both factors influence the environmental health of cities. The residential built environment and the land management behavior of residents affect water quality, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration; and transportation mode choice, number of trips, and trip length affect air quality and carbon emissions. Thus, planning decisions such as development incentives and major transit services upgrades influence a complex set of actions and interactions amongst the various stakeholders: developers, homebuyers, governance and the environment. The likelihood of sound planning choices is predicated upon the ability of planners to model and holistically forecast these interactions.

The acceptance rates of funding proposals often fall below the 10% mark and conference proclaim a low acceptance rate as an indicator for the quality of the event. Researchers suffer from constant rejections while at the same time being measured against high expectations for their promotions. The review systems in place to judge the proposals or publications create an enormous overhead. Senior researchers often spend more time writing funding proposals and reviewing papers than actually doing research. Young researchers suffer from the lack of funding and career opportunities.

This project tries to gain insight into the consequences that a highly competitive research environment has on the conduct of research. More specifically, we aim to understand what the influence the competitiveness has on the productivity of researchers and the quality of their work. 

The project will use social simulation to model the research environment and important factors in it. We will review and extend the Peer-Group-Assessed-Grant-Based-Funding-System (Fang, 2011) to take all the relevant factors into account. We will then run several simulations to examine the influence of competitiveness on the research performed. Next, we will use real world data to verify the model. Last, we will use the model to explore alternative strategies to structure the conduct of science in order to find a stable state in which the true innovative power of science is maximized.

Servicizing Systems facilitate the transition from selling products to providing services. Except for ICT, these are still quite rare. SPREE is dedicated to promote the implementation of Servicizing Systems in 3 different sectors: water, mobility and agri-food. The project uses an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) approach to structure and test options for Servicizing Systems and Policies. This provides a generic framework that allows exploring short and long term effects, and assessment of the 3 sectors in different countries. Based on the models' results and complementary qualitative analysis we will construct 'Servicizing Policy Packages' that take into account the environmental, economic and social dimensions and trade-offs between them. Based on conceptualization of Servicizing Systems, the project will use existing instruments and develop new tools that fit into the evaluation of emerging Servicizing Systems and policies' effects. We define more suitable dynamic tools needed for ex-ante assessment of newly created supply chains that can emerge out of Servicizing activities.

Using ABM, we demonstrate how Servicizing Systems develop and test outcomes of proposed policies on the creation of successful Servicizing opportunities leading to absolute decoupling.

TELL ME (Transparent communication in Epidemics: Learning Lessons from experience, delivering effective Messages, providing Evidence) is a 36 month project funded by the European Commission within Framework 7, which aims to provide evidence and to develop models for improved risk communication during infectious disease crises. TELL ME combines public health, social sciences, behavioral sciences, political sciences, law, ethics, communication and media, in order to develop original communication strategies regarding complicated messages and advice based on uncertainties.

 We are now looking for a researcher to design, construct and test a prototype of an agent-based model for simulating the communications before, during and after an epidemic outbreak. The model will include the various actors involved, including health agencies, government, the media, experts and the public and, in coded and simplified form, the content of the ‘messages’ sent between these actors.

Education: We seek a PhD candidate with an excellent master’s degree (Diploma) in Psychology. 
Knowledge and experience: Ideally the candidate is experienced with quantitative social-science methods such as questionnaire development and statistical analysis of the results as well as in modeling and simulation. Having a background in complex systems, agent based modeling or multi-agent simulation is an advantage. Good spoken and writing skills in English are necessary.
Personality: The candidate is able and willing to work closely with other members of an interdisciplinary team. Because questionnaire and interview studies will be in German good command of Swiss German or German is an important asset. He or she should also be interested in integrating ambiguous, contested information emerging from the participatory process to find a site for a nuclear waste repository.
","The doctoral project “Tipping points in public opinion. A Multi-Agent System simulating shifts from indifferent and ambivalent to polarized opinions” is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Employment will be by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag: http://www.eawag.ch/index_EN); the work will be mainly carried out at the Natural and Social Science Interface at ETH (http://www.uns.ethz.ch/). 

=== PhD project description ===
Projecting the public’s opinion and voting behavior especially regarding a contested and value-laden issue is difficult but highly relevant from a policy planning perspective. Theoretical considerations on how people form and exchange their opinions are available. However, it is largely unknown how exactly people form opinions about specific issues and how from these micro opinions a macro (= public) opinion emerges. That is, how do people develop their opinion – especially in response to media communications, influence from their social networks, and various PR campaigns? 
In the proposed project, we investigate the formation and development of opinions about a planned repository for radioactive waste in Switzerland that is highly contested; an intense and long-term participatory process for selecting the respective sites is ongoing (for more information see http://www.bfe.admin.ch/radioaktiveabfaelle/index.html?lang=en) to gain acceptance of the public. 
We will apply multiple methods to investigate the research goals: Previous (own) data collected via questionnaires and interviews provides an extensive knowledge base. However, some tailored data about details of the opinion formation process have to be investigated via personal in-depth interviews. Additionally, we use web-based questionnaire method to consider in a quantitative way two important dimensions that explain opinions about radioactive waste: risks and benefits. The dynamics will be modeled and simulated by means of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) preferably using NetLogo Software.

Context
In a landscape managed by multiple owners varying from homeowners and non-agricultural businesses through to estates and agri-businesses, co-ordinated management of biodiversity is a challenge. Landscape fragmentation, climate change and habitat change all pose threats to species survival, whilst pro-environmental incentives are focused on individual landowners of particular types. In a special feature of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA in 2007, Ostrom (2007) espoused the idea that there are ‘no panaceas’ for governance of socio-ecosystems towards the sustainable use of environmental resources. Brondizio et al. (2009) meanwhile argue that there is no fixed scale that is most appropriate to manage ecosystems. Given the failure to meet the 2010 Convention on Biodiversity Targets noted in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 and the adoption of the 2020 targets at EU and national levels, it is important to address the role of spatial, social, cultural and individual context in determining the effectiveness of measures aimed at promoting biodiversity. Since one way of evaluating such effectiveness is to use computer simulations of socio-environmental systems, such models need to address context. The goal of this work is to measure various ways in which context affects modelling and simulation work, focusing on how contextual variables influence path-dependence in a coupled socio-ecosystem model. In so doing, questions of how to address context in model design, whether context affects outcomes in the real world, and whether the context of the research affects model boundary will also need to be investigated.
In complex socio-environmental systems, simple explanations of relationships among observed phenomena are likely to be the exception rather than the rule. Hence, in considering such relationships it is necessary to consider how they are influenced by context and, crucially, when context has to be taken into account. In addition to spatio-temporal aspects, context has dimensions pertaining to agent interconnectedness at different levels and scales: social and environmental, involving interpersonal and interspecific interactions. Existing results from a landscape-scale model of farm decision-making and biodiversity (FEARLUS-SPOMM) have demonstrated in theory that the effectiveness of policy implementation options aimed at increasing biodiversity can be significantly influenced by context. 
Objectives
The objectives of this research are to study the role of context in simulation of socio-environmental systems at three levels, with a focus on the second: 
1.	Context in the simulation: How should our understanding of context influence the way decision-making is represented in agent-based models? How can we efficiently represent ‘context-aware’ agents? 
2.	Context of the simulation: What constraints are imposed by context on where a socio-environmental system can go: how do initial conditions and exogenous scenario variables influence model behaviour? What evidence is there for the influence of context variables on system outcome in the real world? 
3.	Context of the research: How does the context of the research influence representation in the model and model boundary? What is the sensitivity of model predictions to variations in context? How should we reflect context when presenting results to different audiences? 
The outcome of the research will be an evidence-based understanding of how context influences pro-environmental behaviour with respect to land management, and how to address it in models designed to explore possible outcomes from pro-environmental incentive mechanisms.

3/8/2013 15:42:46,PhD position at Southampton University,"Southampton, UK",University of Southampton,,"Together with partners from the human connectome project (http://www.humanconnectome.org/) and the Oxford Centre for functional MRI of the brain, we plan to develop advanced network models to study system level connectivity in the human brain. 

The human brain is a complex network of interconnected neural components with network structures existing at several scales. A deeper understanding of these will allow us to better understand and diagnose a range of brain disorders, many of which are progressive and debilitating. There is therefore a significant, on-going effort in the development of models that describe the brain’s connectivity on a system level. For example, the human connectome project is currently in the process of using cutting-edge methods of non-invasive neuroimaging to collect data on 1200 healthy adults, providing a freely accessible reference data-set which can be used for future studies of brain development, aging, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. 

Using pre-publication access to the latest functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the human connectome project as well as data-sets of simulated brain networks, the aim in this study will be to develop better statistical tools to estimate network structures. A recent study comparing a wide range of network modelling algorithms for brain network analysis indicates that one of the most promising approaches is based on Bayesian network models. Bayesian networks are probabilistic network models that conveniently encode statistical dependencies, which can be used to estimate causal information flow within the brain. 

Current application of Bayesian network models to the study of brain function assumes static networks. However, there is evidence of dynamic changes in system level brain interaction and this will the aspect you will investigate. To do this, you will study and extend Bayesian network methodologies, build dynamic brain network models and study typical dynamics of fMRI data.

Project title: Physical crowds and psychological crowds: Applying self-categorization theory to computer simulation of intergroup events

Project supervisors: Dr John Drury and Dr Andy Philippides

This project will examine the behaviour of different psychological crowds within the same physical crowd. It will apply concepts from social psychology to crowd modelling, using a combination of psychological methods and computer simulation.

Recent approaches to the computer modelling of crowds have proved highly effective in explaining emergent patterns in aggregates of people and small group behaviour within crowd flow. What has yet to be modelled is crowd behaviour in intergroup settings – that is, situations where a physical crowd or aggregate contains two or more psychological crowds. 

This PhD studentship will address this lack by operationalizing concepts from self-categorization theory to model large group behaviour where there is more than one such large group present. The successful candidate will use standard methodologies in psychology and computer simulation – specifically agent-based modelling – to model crowd behaviour. Within this framework, the student will be able to select the type of scenario, form of analysis, simulation techniques, and details of experimental design. Supervision will be by Dr John Drury, a social psychologist specializing in crowd behaviour, and Dr Andy Philippides, a computer scientist specializing in simulation of behaviour.

The project is funded by Leverhulme (RPG-2013-140) and the successful student will work alongside a project entitled:  “Collecting and analyzing secondary covert social network data”

 

Standard social network data consist of relations amongst an homogenous group of actors. So that when we represent the data in matrix form the rows and the columns represent the same actors. In contrast, in two mode data we have two types of actors (modes) and there are only connections between different types of actors and no connections within each type. The modes usually represent very different sorts of data. The classic example is when one mode is people and the other mode is events. It should be noted that a lot of historical data and as a consequence covert network data is derived from who attended particular events. Keeping the data in this form allows us to have greater flexibility in any subsequent analysis. However, this means we need to develop innovative and new methods which recognise the restrictions in structure that data in this form implies.

The studentship will focus one or more of the following areas:
- Investigate alternative and novel projection methods for valued data.
- Consider issues with respect to normalization of projected networks.
- Develop new methods (either mathematical or statistical or both) for the direct analysis of multi mode data in particular valued and directed data.
- Extend and evaluate the dual approach to multimode networks.
- Examine the relationship between the various approaches available for multi-mode networks.","The studentship comprise an annual stipend of £13,700, payment of fees up to the level charged for UK/EU students (currently £3,900; overseas students would need to pay the balance in fees themselves) and £750 for research training.

","The Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom, has established a Visiting International Fellowship (VIF) to foster the development of sociological research methods. Between one and three Fellowships are awarded by competition each year. Applicants for the Fellowship will be established scholars in social science with a track record in a field of social research methodology. They will normally hold, or recently have held, an established academic appointment in social science. The Fellowship committee regrets that it cannot consider applications from candidates seeking training or the updating of methodological skills. The VIF is intended for established scholars who are normally at least 5 years post doctorate.

Former VIF holders include: David Morgan (Portland State), David De Vaus (La Trobe), Ed Brent (Missouri), Norman Blaikie (Emeritus, Universiti Sains Malaysia), Irwin Deutscher (Akron), Edith de Leeuw (Utrecht), Seppo Laaksonen (Helsinki), Luis Antunes (Lisbon), Ming Yan (Beijing), Cesar Cisneros (Mexico), Tom W Smith (Chicago), Bob Belli (Lincoln), Jin-Kyu Jung (Grand Forks), Carl Roberts (Iowa), Warren Thorngate (Ottawa), Linda Williams (Massachusetts Lowell) and Gerd Wagner (Germany).

The awards are open to those who would value the opportunity to advance methodological understanding, for example by reflecting on methods used in previous empirical research, by validating existing or new methodological procedures, or by reviewing and synthesising methodological approaches. 'Methods' may be interpreted widely, to include, for example, statistical techniques and conversation and discourse analysis. Proposals for collaborative research with members of the Department of Sociology are especially welcome.

Applications from female and ethnic minority candidates are particularly encouraged.

An award of £2,500 will be made as a contribution towards travel and subsistence expenses incurred in holding the Fellowship.  It is expected that VIF award-holders will normally be on paid leave of absence from their employment.  Award-holders should be prepared to visit the Department on one or two occasions during the academic year with a duration of about one month in total. VIFs will become honorary Research Fellows of the University of Surrey and be entitled to use the University Library and make use of University facilities.

Personality: The candidate is able and willing to work closely with other members of an interdisciplinary team. The successful candidate should appreciate doing research in mountain areas and also be interested in integrating ambiguous information from different sources.
","The interdisciplinary doctoral project “Societal Regime Shifts (SoReShi) in Coupled Systems of Mountain Regions” is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Employment will be by the ETH Zurich, Natural and Social Science Interface (NSSI). 

=== PhD project description ===
To better understand thresholds and shifting regimes in coupled human-environment systems we investigate historic development of societies in interaction with their environments in mountain regions. 
The goal is to identify historical thresholds and regime shifts in the history of three Walser communities located in three case study areas, Visp/Saas Valley (CH), Davos (CH), and Mittelberg (A). We address  relationships among social, ecological, and technological variables over decades and centuries where possible. This content related goal is accompanied by the theoretical question if concepts developed in complex systems and resilience theory can successfully applied for detecting and explaining regime-shifts in human systems.
Key questions are: How did different communities solve trade-offs, e.g. between extensive tourism and landscape preservation, migration, and social coherence (local identity)? How did they cope with massive external and internal disruptions (wars, pests, environmental hazards, famine) choosing from a set options such as migration, invention and utilization of technology and infrastructure, accessing traditional knowledge to manage local ecosystems? What is the “proper” level of openness vs. closedness of societal systems, allowing for exchange and adaptability but keeping social coherence and connectedness. Of specific interest is the role of the strong identity of the respective societies, its role today and future potential. 
The interdisciplinary research team consists of three members: Dr. Roman Seidl (ETHZ, Natural and Social Science Interface NSSI), PD Dr. Matthias Bürgi (Eidg.

Applications are invited for a PhD studentship in the area of complex supply network modeling. The project aims to use network theoretic analysis to model the dynamics of automotive supply networks and allow cost and resilience optimization taking into account commercial, technical and logistics implications.

Supply network research has long assumed linear models yet empirical findings suggest that these networks behave as complex networks at large-scales, and contain non-linear pathways. In this research project, analytical modeling, graph theory, multi-agent based simulation, statistical analysis, and supply chain management theory will be employed to improve the cost and resilience of non-linear supply networks.

Conditions of employment This is a full-time position of a PostDoctoral researcher for a period of 1.5 years. Extension possible if other relevant projects are funded.","We are seeking a Post Doctoral Researcher to join an international project on the development of methods for analysis and visualization of ‘big data’ from computational agent-based models (ABMs) of coupled human-natural systems. This vacancy is part of a multidisciplinary multinational MIRACLE project (MIning Relationships Among variables in large datasets from CompLEx systems). MIRACLE is a joint project between the Center for Social Dynamics & Complexity at the Arizona State University (USA), Centre for Environmental Change and Human Resilience at the University of Dundee and the James Hutton Institute (UK), Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovation at the University of Waterloo (Canada), and the Centre for Studies in Technology&Sustainable Development and the department of Geo-information Processing at the University of Twente (NL). The bottom-up structure of ABMs enables simulation and investigation of complex systems and their emergent behavior with a high level of detail; however the stochastic nature and potential combinations of parameters of such models create large non-linear multidimensional ‘big data’, which are difficult to analyze using traditional statistical methods. Our project addresses this challenge by developing algorithms and web-based analysis and visualization tools that provide automated means of discovering complex relationships among ‘big’ output data of social science ABMs fitted with empirical data. The Post Doctoral Researcher will (i) perform multiple model runs of the spatial ABM of a housing market under various parameter settings, (ii) mine, analyze, and synthesize large-scale model output data, and (iii) collect and extend methods for statistical analysis and visualization of non-linear, discontinuous and often power-law distributed data from spatial ABMs of this and other complex socio-ecological systems. In addition a close cooperation with the Canadian, US and UK project partners on the development of web-based facilities for interactive visualization and analysis of archives of ABMs output data is anticipated. The Post Doctoral Researcher will be appointed at the Centre for Studies in Technology and Sustainable Development (CSTM) at the School of Management and Governance (SMG). There will be close cooperation with the Department of Geoinformation Processing (GIP) at The Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC).

Quantification and Management of Risk & Uncertainty in Complex Systems
& Environments within the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty at the
University of Liverpool invites applicants for a PhD studentship in
the area of agent-based simulation applied to modeling risk in the
manufacturing supply chain.

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
This studentship will model risk and uncertainty in the manufacturing
supply chain, in particular as a result of disparities in production
schedules emanating from independently controlled, but functionally
interconnected, enterprises. Research will investigate quantifying the
risk associated with reliance on intermediate enterprises in the
supply chain to deliver on time. The supply chain system will be
modelled as a multiagent simulation, where individual enterprises are
represented as agents that control the flow of ""goods"" (resources)
through the system. The research will explore the application of
mechanism design to the behaviour of interconnected enterprises,
viewing the problem of maintaining a steady flow of goods amongst
entities as a resource allocation problem.

8/28/2014 16:24:42,PhD position at Southampton,"Southampton, UK",University of Southampton - EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Computational Modelling,,"The phenomenon of the ""flash crash"" is inextricably linked with the emergence of fragmented electronic financial markets in recent years, where each asset can now be traded on a number of different venues (i.e. exchanges and dark pools). The Flash Crash differs from the familiar long-standing type of financial crash in three ways. First, as its name suggests, it happens very, very fast - usually in under a second. Second, it is often accompanied by a similarly fast post-crash recovery. Third, there appears to be a lot of them. This suggests that market structure and behaviour are at the very least different from what we understand from history - which raises questions about our understanding of the stability and fragility of these markets, and possibly about their efficacy and efficiency as price discovery tools. There is a lack of rigorous scientific analysis and evidence on these questions.

The first aim of this research project is to use agent-based modelling to categorise the different types of high frequency trading strategies, and use simulations to measure their effect on observed market patterns. The developed simulation platform is then validated by comparing the results against patterns observed in real high frequency data. Once the agent-based system is developed and validated, the second aim of the project is to use the platform as a testbed to evaluate market policies which discourage harmful high frequency trading behaviour, and to compare interventions by financial exchanges to prevent systemic risk.",Funding information: This project is in competition with others for the associated funding.

- good programming skills;
- good spoken and writing skills in English. 
Having a background in multi-agent systems, organisation modelling or multi-agent simulation is a plus. ","This position is part of the SHINE (Social Heterogeneous Information Network Environment) project and will be performed as a cooperation between the research group Men-Machine Interaction at the Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, and the research group ICT at the Faculty Technology, Policy and Management.
The main research question of this project is “How can heterogeneous resources (people, mobile sensors, fixed sensors, social media, information systems, ...) self-organize for answering dynamic information needs?” This PhD project will focus on the organizational development and analysis aspects of such systems. In order to achieve their goals, actors (sensors, people, or autonomous agents) participating in integrated society monitoring systems require means for coordination and cooperation that take into account their requirements and (institutional) constraints. In fact, participants are assumed to belong to existing organisations and be bound by specific norms of conduct (implicit or explicit). The realization of goal-oriented dynamic cooperation between heterogeneous actors can thus be seen as a network of organisations. Such organisations enable to determine the rules and structure of the transient cooperation but also acknowledge and comply to the norms and expectations of the organisations to whom participants belong.

12/24/2011 11:48:00,PhD Opportunities in the Centre for Spatial Analysis and Policy,University of Leeds,Centre for Spatial Analysis and Policy,"Project 1
This PhD will utilise methodologies found in other modelling communities to enhance socio-economic agent-based models (for a review of the techniques, see Evans, 2011). It will additionally develop new techniques to visualise the evolution over time of error surfaces, and investigate the unique opportunities agent-based modelling can bring to bear on the issue of error propagation in non-linear systems (most notably the accurate replication of those relationships in human society that tend to dampen the propagation of instabilities – social negotiation, compromise, group decision making). The example system used will depend on student interests, however, could be in the areas of retail pricing, crime, or the housing market. The PhD would be suitable for anyone with a computational, mathematical, or physics-centred background, or anyone with a geographical, geological, meteorological, environmental, or sociological background and a strong interest in modelling human or physical environments.

Project 2
The overarching aim of this PhD is the creation of a new classification of criminal behaviour that will be used for creation of a customised population for an existing agent-based model. The objectives can be broken down into:

i. A critique of existing classifications and an identification of their shortcomings in terms of grouping types of criminal behaviour;

ii. Detailed spatiotemporal analysis of the known movement of criminals;

iii. Linkage of movements to geodemographics to create a new behaviour classification;

iv. Testing of the new classification through (i) creation of a customised population and (ii) benchmarking against an existing models.","Project 1 - Dynamic Data Assimilation and Error Management in Agent-based Socioeconomic Systems.

Traditionally social science models have been either static (in the sense that they replicate or predict a single time slice of a social system), or have dynamics that work with a ‘fixed rudder’ (in the sense that they are initiated and then run over time to replicate or predict some end-point, with no opportunity for adjusting the running model). This is actually rather unusual for geographical models as both these model pathways have considerable error issues. In the case of static models, there is almost no way to appropriately check the error involved in new predictions. In the case of ‘fixed rudder’ models, the errors involved in modelling non-linear systems ‘explode’ as the model runs, making most predictions extremely dubious (the potential error variance is generally far larger than the potential range of model results).

Project 2 - Capturing and simulating criminal behaviour through advanced spatial analysis and agent-based modelling

Classifications of criminal behaviour are largely limited through one of the following: size of the group of individuals; poor consideration of spatio-temporal movement and often poor, or no linkage to geodemographics or other indicators of socio-economic status. This project will apply advanced spatial analysis methodologies to a database of tens of thousands of individual reported crime events over a 5-10 year period of time to develop a more realistic and detailed classification of criminal behaviour based on spatial movement. The classification will be further enhanced through the inclusion of literature and other national data sets such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation and those provided by local government such as unemployment data, abandoned buildings, council administered benefits and health status information.","The PhD Studentship is fully funded for UK/EU applicants, and is offered by the Systems Centre, University of Bristol.","please contact myself (n.malleson06@leeds.ac.uk), Andrew Evans (A.J.Evans@leeds.ac.uk) or Alison Heppenstall (A.J.Heppenstall@leeds.ac.uk).
