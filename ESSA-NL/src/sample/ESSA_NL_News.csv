Agent-based simulations model complex societies by simulating the ways that individuals in that population interact. The simulation works because the behavior of large groups of humans is very similar to that of insects, birds, and most other animals. Although the agent-based simulator does not simulate the actual battles, it does model how the army moved from one location to another, an achievement that requires substantial parallel processing power. The researchers aim to demonstrate a multi-agent model based approach to early military logistics, as well as explore infrastructures and algorithms for building very large multi-agent models.",http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/26595/?p1=Blogs,Sascha,,"ABM technical, ABM methodical",218

Led by ETH Zurich scientist Dirk Helbing, the project aims to develop the Living Earth Simulator to facilitate the modeling and analysis of techno-commercial-sociological-ecological systems, and will be capable of considering interactions between up to 10 billion individuals. FutureICT plans not just to recognize early-stage financial or economic crises, but also to connect different areas together. Integral to the initiative's success is a platform that can record and analyze massive data volumes, transfer them to computer models, and make them universally usable. New data-mining methods and real-time data set collection also will be vital. The project will be interdisciplinary, bringing together computer scientists, information and communications technology specialists, complexity scientists, economists, sociologists, and sustainability and systemic risk experts.

5/13/2011 18:57:41,How to Control Complex Networks,"Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Northeastern University have developed a computational model that can analyze any type of complex network and find the critical points that can be used to control the entire system. The method can be used to reprogram adult cells and identify new drug targets, among other applications, says MIT professor Jean-Jacques Slotine. The researchers developed an algorithm that determines how many nodes in a network need to be controlled for total network control. They then adapted the algorithm to show how many points are needed and where those points are located. The number of points needed depends on the network's degree distribution, which describes the number of connections per node. The researchers applied their model to several real-life networks, including cell phone networks, social networks, and neuronal networks, calculating the percentage of points that need to be controlled in order to gain total control of the system. The researchers found that sparse networks require a higher number of controlled points than denser networks.",http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/network-control-0512.html,Sascha,,Social Networks,220

Another technology projected to emerge are telepresence robots, which will enable people to remotely interact across great distances, significantly impacting social rules, the workplace, health care, and travel. Meanwhile, brain-machine interfaces may progress beyond mere thought control of computers and other machines, perhaps enhancing memory and other mental functions and challenging long-cherished concepts about identity, culpability, and the acceptable thresholds of human enhancement. The potential ramifications of software that can automatically evolve technology, such as genetic algorithms, include a disruption of research and development and inventing, and experts say evolved inventions are already having a substantial cumulative impact in the acceleration of innovation. Forecasting will likely take a big leap forward with the advent of text-mining applications that tap the vast corpus of data available online to identify trends and make projections, with significant implications for marketing and government policy.",http://www.newscientist.com/special/seven-technologies-to-disrupt-the-decade,Sascha,,Societal Transition,221

How about all the data collected since the beginning of the computer era? The quantity is so huge that traditional units of measurement cannot cope.

For social scientists, the challenge is now to make sense of all these data in a way that illuminates our social world.  This will involve a collaboration between social scientists, who have the concepts, theories and analytical expertise that are needed, and scientists and engineers, especially computer engineers, physicists, and complexity scientists, who are used to handling vast amounts of data.
 
The European Commission, as part of its Framework 7 Programme, has launched a competition for proposals for “Flagship” research initiatives that will make major advances.

The researchers say the agent technology contributes to defining complex behaviors of the entities involved in each scenario, modeling the processes and activities at individual and organizational units in each stage and simulating the behavior of the models.",http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=112442&CultureCode=en,Sascha,,"Societal Transition, Complex Systems",229

The Graaasp project, which recently went online, is designed to be as simple as possible to use while remaining an extensive tool for scientists and students. The main difference between Graaasp and other social networks is that Graaasp focuses on the activities that bring users together, rather than the users themselves. Graaasp accommodates several different types of elements, including contacts, private and public subspaces, multimedia resources, and Web applications. In addition to applications that can be found anywhere on the Web, Graaasp also provides applications that are specifically developed to fit the needs of teaching. ""Our students can thus perform their practical work online, using a small piece of software that can be found in Graaasp,"" says EPFL scientist Denis Gillet. He notes that ""now that the basic platform is functional, we're expecting an organic pattern of adoption, directly involving the users.""",http://actu.epfl.ch/news/a-made-to-measure-social-network-for-the-academic-/,Sascha,,Social Networks,230

UCI researchers, backed by a U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity grant, are collaborating with scientists from the University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Fordham University, Wake Forest University, and Wichita State University. The researchers recently launched models using Forecasting Ace, software that collects individual opinions on the likelihood of certain events within a specified time frame. Before providing input, contributors must complete a short questionnaire in which they rate their subject matter expertise in areas such as science and technology, business and the economy, politics and policy, military and security, and sports and health. Forecasting Ace then analyzes the collected data using models of human decision-making that were created by the UCI researchers.

10/17/2011 11:33:48,"Computational Model of Peace Predicts Social Violence, Harmony","New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) researchers have developed a computational model that analyzes census data to identify potential areas of civil violence, based on the premise that community-level violence is a function of geography modulated by the overlap of political, topographical, and ethnic borders. The researchers, led by NECSI president Yaneer Bar-Yam, found that violence is unlikely when either diverse communities are so integrated that it prevents one group from dominating, or so segregated that political and geographic boundaries match demographic borders. ""Violence arises due to the structure of boundaries between groups rather than as a result of inherent conflicts between the groups themselves,"" Bar-Yam says. The researchers tested the model on data from Switzerland, which is known for its social stability and prosperity, but contains a diverse cultural mix consisting of many languages and religions. The researchers' model found that one area with an increased propensity for violence was the northwest region of the country, where the Jura mountains form a boundary between French and German-speaking communities. This region is exactly where violence erupted in the 1970s.",http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/peace-boundaries/,Sascha,,Social Conflict,231

The program maps the estuary, simulating the movements of five mammal species, the presence and movements of different types of boats, and the environmental conditions. The system is based on actual conditions observed in the estuary since 1994 and takes into account human behaviors based on interviews with those in the shipping industry. The model also takes into account several specific factors, such as the fact that the population of beluga whales is very fragile, having not fully recovered from old hunting practices from more than 40 years ago. The researchers' system can help evaluate and quantify the different factors concerning each species and its environment.",http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20111003-quand-les-baleines-rencontrent-les-bateaux.html,Sascha,,"Complex Systems, Spatial and Ecological-Economic",231

11/25/2011 12:50:24,SBP 2012 Modeling Challenge,"Social media has inarguably played a critical role in facilitating information dissemination in numerous real-world events including citizen protests driven by economic (e.g., the Occupy Wall Street, Greek's the Indignant Citizens Movement) or socio-political crisis (e.g., Egyptian revolution, the Arab Spring), disaster recovery and response (Haiti earthquake), political campaigns, and many others. Prior to such events, the social network is virtually non-existent and emerges dynamically at an overwhelming pace afterwards. A similar phenomenon could be observed during the outbreak of an epidemic, especially in highly mobilized environments. Identifying the nodes that spread the information (epidemic) fastest, early on before the network stabilizes, could have a significant impact in decision making. Companies could also find this problem significant during early product promotions.

Summary information: With the recent release of 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS) data for the 2005-2009 period, RTI has generated a new synthetic population database using the updated ACS demographic data. The synthetic population database contains a computerized representation of every household (112,383,675) and person (282,735,758) who lives in a household in the U.S. with many household-level (for example, household income, householder race, householder age, and household size) and person-level characteristics (for example, age, sex, race, ethnicity). In addition, each household has a latitude/longitude coordinate. The spatial distribution of the synthesized households closely match the general spatial distribution of the U.S. population. The database was created by RTI International (http://www.rti.org) under a grant from the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences called the 'Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study' (or MIDAS, (http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/MIDAS/)).

Repast Simphony 2.0 has many improvements including the use of OpenGL for significantly faster 2D display drawing, dramatic optimization of chart rendering speed, and substantial enhancements to the appearance of the runtime interface. Repast Simphony 2.0 ReLogo has new and enhanced primitives as well as the ability to create ReLogo library projects. Repast Simphony 2.0 also has a new, dramatically faster, data collection architecture and a more flexible supporting user interface.
Unfortunately, the new data collection architecture is incompatible with Repast Simphony 2.0 Beta data sets, charts, and file ""outputters."" New data sets, charts, and file sinks will have to be defined when upgrading models to Repast Simphony 2.0. More information can be found in the following data collection documentation: http://repast.sf.net/docs/DataCollection.pdf
Perhaps most important, Repast Simphony 2.0's supporting tutorials and documentation have been expanded including the addition of new tutorials for ReLogo, Java, and flowchart model creation! These new models include the following demonstrations and tutorials created by students under the leadership Rick Riolo and other mentors during the 2011 Google Summer of Code: http://code.google.com/p/repast-demos/w/list. Thank you Rick and Google! Contributors include Mudit Raj Gupta, Rowan Copely, Tim Sweda, Grace Lin and Richard Oliver Legendi.
Repast for High Performance Computing (HPC) now includes new facilities for efficient random selection of agent sets within contexts, cancellation of agent requests, specifying model parameters at run time, and tracking the record of runs performed.

""We release a new network generation tool MUSKETEER (Multiscale Entropic Network Generator). MUSKETEER generates highly realistic synthetic network data for multiple domains. The tool has been validated in domains such as epidemiological networks, social networks, finite-element meshes, power grids as well as small-world and scale-free networks. MUSKETEER takes empirical network data, which it coarsens and then refines through the multiscale framework (V-cycle). During the refinement phase, it introduces user-controlled perturbations which lead to high-entropy changes of the original data. The problem of network generation can be formulated at all levels of the multiscale hierarchy (depending on the user's preferences to change the entire structure of the network or only several particular scales). The proposed multiscale framework can easily incorporate new features such as invariants that have to be preserved in the generated network. MUSKETEER supports node and edge labels and attributes, multiple network formats.

* Open source based on Python's NetworkX API

8/17/2012 16:42:52,Call for Authors: CALL FOR AUTHORS: Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics,"Social media are revolutionizing and galvanizing politics in the United States and around the world. Old modes and methods of political communication from elites to the masses (top down) and from the masses to elites (bottom up) are being rapidly displaced by new social media, and activists are building new movements and protests using social media to alter mainstream political agendas. Members of Congress now routinely turn to Twitter to spar with partisan opponents or broadcast messages to constituents, and use YouTube to post their latest campaign advertisements. The power of social media in politics is not isolated to the United States. In the popular uprisings triggered by the Arab Spring social media have played an enormous part in the organizing of protests and keeping dissident voices from being completely stifled by repressive regimes, despite attempts by those regimes to restrict access to the Internet and social media platforms or technologies. In approximately 400 signed articles, this 2-volume reference work will cover the phenomenon of social media and politics in an A-to-Z format.

If you would like to contribute to building a truly outstanding reference with the Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics, please contact Lisbeth Rogers by the e-mail politics@golsonmedia.com.

I still have a long ways to go, but there may be enough material that already exists to be useful for GeoMason users.  Interested folks can find the raw LaTeX file in ""mason/contrib/geomason/docs"" in the MASON subversion repository, which I periodically update.  However, you can get a snapshot of the Cookbook from the URL below.  I will strive to keep that up to date, but probably not as frequently as I do the subversion repository version.

We are pleased to announce a new R package called Nopp 1.0.0 (Nash Optimal Party Positions).

Nopp enables to compute party/candidate ideological positions that correspond to a Nash Equilibrium along a one-dimensional space. It accommodates alternative motivations in (each) party strategy while allowing to estimate the uncertainty around their optimal positions through two different procedures (bootstrap and MC). We consider Nopp to be particularly useful for scholars studying electoral competition.",http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nopp/vignettes/nopp.pdf,Richard,POLMETH,"Policy Making, Societal Transitions, Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General",258

Dear Big-Data enthusiasts, 

Alex (Sandy) Pentland and the Human Dynamics Lab of the MIT Media Lab are pleased to announce the launch of the Reality Commons web portal: http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu

On Reality Commons, we release four mobile data sets, collected from 2004 onward, that contain the dynamics of several communities of about 100 people each. We invite researchers to propose and submit their own applications of the data to demonstrate the scientific and business values of the data sets, suggest how to meaningfully extend these experiments to larger populations, and to develop the math that fits agent-based or systems dynamics models to larger populations. 

As we aim to unlock the enormous potential of these data with your collaboration, you'll find README files and other tools to assist you in getting started with accessing and downloading the data.  

Inquiries about the Reality Commons and its data should be directed to the following: 
- For general questions about the website or research studies, please contact Todd Reid - tgreid@media.mit.edu

1/4/2013 11:04:47,On-line SFI Course on Complexity,"Introduction to Complexity

Santa Fe Institute will be launching a series of MOOCs (Massive Open On-line Courses), covering the field of complex systems science. Our first course, Introduction to Complexity, will be an accessible introduction to the field, with no pre-requisites. You don't need a science or math background to take this introductory course; it simply requires an interest in the field and the willingness to participate in a hands-on approach to the subject.

In this eleven-week course, you'll learn about the tools used by complex systems scientists to understand, and sometimes to control, complex systems. The topics you'll learn about include dynamics, chaos, fractals, information theory, self-organization, agent-based modeling, and networks. You’ll also get a sense of how these topics fit together to help explain how complexity arises and evolves in nature, society, and technology.

Introduction to Complexity will be free and open to anyone. The instructor is Melanie Mitchell, External Professor at SFI, Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University, and author of the award-winning book, Complexity: A Guided Tour. The course will begin in early 2013.

It is a publication of the European Political Attitudes and Mentalities Research Community. It welcomes original interdisciplinary research approaches which combine political science, sociology, social-psychology, history, anthropology and computer sciences. It aims at providing the governments of the European countries and the EU with high quality analysis and predictions able to give scientific and pragmatic support for the achievement of good governance and for the development of complex public policies. EQPAM aims at using the expertise of Eastern European scholars in the area of sociology, history, and political science in order to better know and understand the historical heritage of the political culture of the Eastern European countries, the political attitudes and mentalities of these people. The post-communist regimes in several Eastern European countries are oftenly analysed in close relation to the EU problematics in managing the increasing number of its member countries. The past and present EU difficulties and crises could thus be better understood and such knowledge could guide both civil society's actions and governments' policies.

The members of the EQPAM's Editorial Board have areas of expertise ranging from history and anthropology, history of relligions, sociology and social-psychology, political philosophy, philosophy of science and culture, political sciences and computer sciences. The authors are European faculty as well as young doctoral fellows and research scientists from several famous European universities and research centres.

7/20/2013 14:28:36,Real Time Prediction of Violent Conflict Tournament,"On behalf of Kristian Skrede Gleditsch/Gerald Schneider:

The prediction of violent conflict has become a widespread and increasingly professional activity within the scientific study of war and conflict. This growing importance has, however, not lead to a convergence in the methods used to generate forecasts or systematic studies assessing the accuracy of predictions. This has impeded developing our understanding of the relative advantages of different forecasting approaches and principled discussion of features that are relatively easier or difficult to forecast. Some models might only be able to predict one manifestation of political violence, while a competing model scores better on another dimension. The lack of integrative research on forecasting is one of the major limitations for promoting these tools as effective early warning mechanism that could be used to prevent further escalation.

The ""tournament"" that we organize and hope to publish as a joint article with the teams of forecasters will address these challenges head-on and explore three dimensions conflict (conflict intensity, escalation /de-escalation and phase shifts) as well as the relative merits of different forecasting model in predicting the occurrence of violence ex ante. To this end, we will collect data on an on-going conflict like the civil wars in Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan until December 31, 2012, and provide participants with the data in the beginning of 2014. All participating teams would use the same data and provide the forecasts until January 31, 2014. A non-technical summary of the forecasts of 800 words length with a maximum of two tables and/or illustrations will be due on February 28, 2014; these reports may be accompanied by larger technical appendices potentially accompanying the article. All accepted teams would have to provide a signed statement that they only used the finally released data set for the creation of the forecasts and that they particularly did not develop an independent training data set to pre-adjust their technology to the chosen conflict. Forecasts would have to be developed at least for two of the conflict attributes simultaneously.

Please submit abstracts with a maximum of 200 words until September 15, 2013",Gerald.Schneider@uni-konstanz.de,Richard,POLMETH,"Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Societal Transitions, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics, Methods in General, Game Theory, Complex Systems, Social Networks",264

Using the blog format allows contributors to get their ideas seen and discussed by a wide audience faster than the usual conference and journal publication venues. Our WordPress backbone allows authors to present graphics, computer code with syntax highlighting, and equations typeset in LaTeX. Posts are publicized to our followers on Facebook and Twitter, as well as our RSS feed and e-mail subscribers; we hope that you will take a moment to add yourself to one or more of these lists by visiting
http://tpm.blogs.rice.edu/follow-tpm-online/.

We encourage everyone in the political methodology community, and in the wider community of quantitative social science, to submit blog posts to thepoliticalmethodologist@gmail.com. In particular, we are interested in publishing posts that feature:

1) critical commentary or discussion of issues of relevance to the methodological community, including working papers and new software;
2) questions for our ""Ask a Methodologist"" feature (http://tpm.blogs.rice.edu/ask-a-methodologist/);

""Today the software and code that drive many scientific studies (and ultimately their results) are far from standardized. Often seen as a means to and end this code may not be made available to readers of scientific journals or even the reviewers. Can projects like Open ABM affect positive change when it comes to the peer review process; making it easier to verify that code often hidden down in the weeds of a scientific study?

Scientists working with computational models are typically reporting on the validity of a particular model when they present their results (i.e. how well it fits the data and its usefulness as a predictor for the phenomenon under consideration). But what happens when there is a moth in the tubes, a bug in the code? A recent Nature news article by Erika Check Hayden addresses the verification issue and some of its implications while highlighting a Mozilla project aimed at putting such code through a review process similar to that associated with commercial software products.

Mozilla plan seeks to debug scientific code  Software experiment raises prospect of extra peer review. Erika Check Hayden 24 September 2013

Note that in the comments section on the Nature site, the author points to Open ABM as a model for getting source code out into the world.

""Erika Check - 2013-09-25 08:16 PM These didn’t fit in the story, but two other projects trying to encourage peer review of code are CoMSES Net (http://www.openabm.org/) in ecology and social sciences and…""",http://www.openabm.org/forum/role-code-archiving-projects-peer-review-process,Richard,OpenABM,"Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General, Complex Systems",266

The estimation is carried out via the user-friendly microsimulation model SORESI. Responsible civil servants are able to manipulate monetary social benefits on a website and the model quickly calculates the outcomes on the income situation of the Europe 2020 social target group. At the same time the website can be used by the general public for other simulations (incl. social insurance contributions and income tax) and inquiries (e.g. outcomes on the income distribution, outcomes for certain socio-economic groups, budgetary consequences). This Policy Brief describes the most important features of the SORESI model and presents a policy reform example related to the increase of the family allowance.",http://www.euro.centre.org/detail.php?xml_id=2331,Richard,Simsoc,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics, Complex Systems",269

12/24/2011 10:06:34,Social Network Big Data Hackathon @ Sunbelt,"Manual collection of social network data is so XXth century! New sources of social network data such as Twitter, Facebook, OpenCongress, CrunchBase, and many others, present data at the scale up to 100s of millions of nodes and billions of edges, with millions of nodes and edges added every hour. In this environment, traditional SNA algorithms and metrics falter due to their high computational complexity and difficulty of parallelization. Big Data approaches such as Map/Reduce, Hive, Pig and Storm, distributed data storage solutions of Hadoop, Redis and MongoDB hold a promise that SNA algorithms can be made to work over web-scale data — but much work is required to make this happen. We are soliciting papers, demos and tutorials on:
- Software — open-source or academic-license tools
- Big Social Data problems, solutions and war stories
- Data warehousing, data manipulation, data wrangling and wrestling
- Streaming graph analysis, real-time data analysis, dynamic network analysis
- Real-world applications
- … any topic relevant to analysis of big, real-time, social network and social stream data

Part 1 of the workshop shall be devoted to practical aspects of dealing with big data — perhaps more of a tutorial to get everyone up to speed. We’ll select practical papers for this section.
Part 2 will be in a Hackathon format — we will start by setting up a distributed, real-time cloud computing “playground”, turn on a fast and high-volume data stream, and, at the end of the workshop, leave with meaningful adaptations of SNA metrics and algorithms to real-time, high-volume data. We will encourage formation of impromptu teams and collaborations, especially joint work involving academics and industry.
Part 3 — The Red-Eye session — will be devoted to presentations of the hackathon participants and academic and industry “war stories”.
Hackathon attendees are expected to be proficient programmers in languages of their choice, and bring high-performance laptops to the workshop. They’ll need all the computing horsepower they can get. We’ll also provide generic Amazon EC2 instances for cloud computing

Special issue of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Law
(http://www.springer.com/10506/)

Paper Submission Deadline: November 25th, Friday

Issue editors:Giulia Andrighetto, Rosaria Conte, Eunate Mayor, and Giovanni Sartor


Call for papers
==================

We invite papers concerned with the application of computer simulation,
and in particular  agent-based simulation,  to the study of norms,
normative systems  (including, but not limited to, the law) and
norm-governed behaviour (compliance with norms, their violation, their
enforcement, etc.).


We believe that agent-based  simulation can provide a unique
contribution to the study of norms and laws. We also believe that the
simulation of social behaviour can profit from the models of norms  and
institutions developed within legal research, and in particular from
those developed within AI & law. With this special issue we hope to
stimulate the interplay of computer simulation,  legal research and AI
(cognitive science) in the dynamic modelling of normative and legal
phenomena, and to  prompt a reflection  on the potential of agent-based
simulation  for  law- and policy-making.


Submission Details
==================

Authors are invited to submit an original, previously unpublished,
research paper pertaining to any of the above mentioned topics. The
paper should follow the specifications of the journal as detailed:

http://www.springer.com/computer/artificial/journal/10506

Paper should be submitted through the website of the journal specifying
that it is to included in the special issue on ""Simulation, norms and
laws"":

http://www.springer.com/10506

Each submitted paper will be carefully peer-reviewed based on
originality, significance,  technical soundness, and clarity of
exposition and relevance for the journal.
