Topics will range over the naturalness and even inevitability of
certain kinds of ignorance and the unnaturalness or deliberate production of other kinds - for example, on ignorance created through government secrecy and censorship, cultural prejudice, industry influence on scientific research, and so on - and the epistemological and societal implications of such ignorance.
The ultimate goal is to make a significant contribution to this new kind of enquiry.

But can they both be true? And are we really disagreeing in case they are? Relativists typically tend to answer both questions in the affirmative. As innocent as this position may seem at first sight, it certainly involves some rather dramatic changes in the way philosophers usually think about formal semantics. Then again, these changes seem to offer elegant solutions to further problems besetting semantics, such as the assessment of future contingents, the variability of knowledge ascriptions and the correct analysis of epistemic modals. The conference will be concerned with different relativist proposals, with its consequences, and with possible alternative analyses of the phenomena motivating relativism.",http://rvps2011.net/relativism/,Richard,,,5/1/2011,218

These patterns and relationships can, in turn, be used to create models of data. Simulations based on these models then can be used to generate data and start the cycle anew. Modeling and simulation (M&S) can benefit from KD by providing a means to evaluate the realism, novelty, interestingness, and utility of the created model. KD can benefit M&S by providing a means to understand the large amount of data generated by simulations. Recent developments in the ability to mine complex, highly-structured data of the form typically produced by large scale simulations may provide opportunities for useful knowledge discovery of simulation outputs. Specific objectives are to identify:
-- How knowledge discovery can produce patterns that can be useful in the development of models; 
-- How to effectively and usefully mine the results of large numbers of potentially complex simulations created by executing models; and 
-- Other potential synergies that may result from “closing the loop” between KD and M&S.",http://discoveryandmodeling.org,Sascha,,,,222

We also expect to appeal social scientists interested in developing their research in interdisciplinary teams that include representatives of the natural sciences.
In this Summer School the students a) are going to be introduced to the formal methods that are used in social complexity studies: game theory, experimental analysis, social dynamics, agent-based simulations and social network analysis; b) get exposed to applications of these methods to problems being as diverse as the distribution of wealth, spatial segregation, knowledge dynamics, the common pool resources; and c) are going to have the opportunity to develop their own approaches to problems posed by the researchers.
Starting from this premise, we hope to promote the development of interdisciplinary research projects in social complexity and strengthen the relationship between researchers and the private/public sector intending to address problems of the social reality relevant for the environment of the ISCV.
Information: Vacancies limited to 15 places for representatives of the natural sciences; and 5 for representatives of the social sciences. Successful applications will receive full scholarships. Scholarships cover subsistence and accommodation costs as well as transport within the city of Valparaíso, not included are travel costs outside of Valparaíso, these are covered by the student.
Eligibility: Post-graduate students or with a post-graduate degree in natural sciences, e.g. engineering, biology, physics or mathematics; and social sciences, e.g. anthropology, sociology or political science.

In a first step, we tackle the key methodological challenges of concept-building, causation and micro-macro-linkage that occur in all research efforts and aim at a clarification of the epistemological implications underlying methodological paradigms. In a second step, we apply these methodological considerations by looking at how central empirical fields of research in political science and sociology have dealt with these challenges and – by referring to selected empirical studies – what solutions have been found to overcome them. Furthermore, participants are provided with hands-on research advice and have the opportunity to present their own work and approaches to these issues.
The Berlin Summer School is a joint endeavor of two of Germany’s leading social science institutions, the Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences (BGSS) at Humboldt-UniversitätzuBerlin and the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB).
The two-week summer school both attracts internationally renowned scholars and draws on Berlin-based faculty. Among the confirmed international lecturers are Delia Baldassarri (Princeton University), Peter Bearman (Columbia University), Mark Bevir (UC Berkeley), Craig Calhoun (NYU/LSE), Donatella Della Porta (EUI), Ronald Inglehart (University of Michigan), and Klaus von Beyme (Universität Heidelberg).
The international summer school is open to thirty PhD candidates. Due to generous funding by the BGSS and the WZB, there will be no tuition fee.

- formalisation
- validation & verification
- gather empirical data
- simulation experiments
- tools (MAS/ABM toolkits, statistical tools, etc)
- programming

This workshop introduces participants to computational agent-based modeling (ABM) of spatial systems. We present ABM programming algorithms and advise for the beginners in agent-based modeling. NetLogo is the principal multi-agent programming environment in this workshop. Participants will receive handouts describing the algorithms and their documentations, as well as electronic copies of the NetLogo implementation. We will show examples where direct interactions drive system behavior, in particular the application of agent-based modeling to a Residential Segregation problem where spatial patterns emerge from the uncoordinated actions of heterogeneous agents. The workshop proceeds in stages where (i) ABM techniques and application to Residential Segregation problem are presented; (ii) the role of space is examined; (iii) participants worked through ABM tutorials.

These data provide an unprecedented exploratorium to model the socio-technical motivations for creating, maintaining, dissolving, and reconstituting into teams – for research, business, or social causes. Using examples from research in virtual organizations and massively multiplayer online games, Contractor will argue that Network Science serves as the foundation for the development of social network theories and methods to help advance our ability to understand the emergence of effective teams. More importantly, he will argue that these insights will also enable effective teams by building a new generation of recommender systems that leverage our research insights on the socio-technical motivations for creating ties.

The program is completely taught in English.

Our program offers structured and systematic training in theoretically and methodologically advanced research in sociology and in the social sciences in general.

Special features of the program include:
- A problem-driven approach with a substantive focus on topics such as social networks and social capital, migration, social integration, stratification and inequality, households, and organizations.
- A strong focus on the integration of social theory and methods of data-analysis.
- Hands on experience in state of the art techniques of social science data analysis.
- Hands on experience in writing a publishable research article: the master's thesis that completes the program is written in the format of an article. Many students have had article versions of their theses accepted for publication in journals like Social Forces, Social Networks, Journal of Marriage and the Family, or European Union Politics. In addition, quite some students meanwhile gained prizes and awards for their theses.
- The program comprises a master class taught by an outstanding visiting professor from abroad. Previous visiting professors include Andreas Diekmann, ETH Zurich; Hartmut Esser, Mannheim; Frank Kalter, Mannheim; Hans-Peter Blossfeld, Bamberg; Ted Mouw, North Carolina, Walter Muller, Mannheim; Anthony Heath, Oxford; Daniel McFarland, Stanford.Bonnie Erickson, Toronto, will be our visiting professor in 2013.
- Sociology and Social Research students themselves organize a mini-conference on their own research projects.
- Students are encouraged to participate in summer schools like Essex or Ljubljana.
- Students in the program benefit from intensive supervision. Instructors involved in teaching and supervision include prominent researchers such as Vincent Buskens, Tanja van der Lippe, Ineke Maas, Paul Nieuwbeerta,Anne-Rigt Poortman, Frank van Tubergen, Beate Volker, Jeroen Weesie, and others.

This workshop is funded by a grant from the methods@manchester initiative. The course is free to attend and will be suitable for people without any experience of computer programming, but is particularly aimed at post-graduate social researchers, e.g. PhD students, post-docs, lecturers. 

This workshop will introduce participants to the modelling of dynamic social processes, such as group membership, influence, imitation, collaboration and innovation, through a series of agent-based simulations. 

Participants will gain understanding of the simulation of social processes by exploring working simulation models and by adapting these models to describe different types of process. It will give participants a first-hand experience of complexity science including the ideas of emergence, self-organisation, chaos, ‘lock in’ and dynamic systems. We will also consider the limitations and difficulties of such techniques, and how they complement more traditional approaches in the social sciences.

This will be a largely hands-on course, exposing participants to a series of simulation models in the NetLogo simulation language. It will include: brief introductions, simplified example models, guided suggestions for interacting with them and assistants to help when you get stuck. There will be some summary sessions to bring out the lessons learnt and additional materials to guide participants onto the next steps of working with simulations.

Here the behaviour of agents in the simulation represents the behaviour of actors, with the interaction between actors represented as messages between the agents. The outcomes of such simulations are not always obvious from their set-up allowing for the phenomena of emergence. This kind of simulation has its own distinctive opportunities and problems, which has meant that it has tended to be reported in different venues from the main simulation community, being closer to social rather than computer science. It does allow for social science issues to be represented explicitly and explored, which enables for their consequences to be better understood and also for the outcomes to be compared to observed outcomes.  This track is a chance to bring the social simulation and wider simulation communities together and should be of particular interest to those from the social science end of the spectrum, including (but not limited to) social scientists themselves. 

 Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

    Reputation and endorsement processes

    Group formation, maintenance, dissolution

    Social emergence and unpredictability

    Influence and interaction over social networks

    Descriptive simulations of observed social processes and systems (e.g. science itself)

    How trust develops and is maintained plus its effects

    Cooperation, coordination and social norms (but not purely game theoretic approaches)

    People interacting via the internet via Facebook, Flickr, Twitter etc.

    Discussive, consensus and agreement processes

    Social and culture dynamics

    The simulation of historical patterns and past societies

    complex organisation behaviour and inter-organisational networks

Please note that if your simulation is to model the results of policy, it probably should go to the Policy Modelling track, and that if it concentrates on the more computer science aspects of simulating or is not modelling interaction between social actors then it probably belongs to the Agent-Based Modelling track.",http://www.scs-europe.net/conf/ecms2013/socint.html,Richard,"Agent-Based Modelling, Complex Systems, Social Networks",Bruce Edmonds <bruce@edmonds.name>,2/15/2013,260

EASSS has been organized annually in different European locations since its initiation.

EASSS attracts about 100 students each year. The school provides a wide range of state-of-the-art courses given by the most prominent
researchers in the area. A typical course is 4 hours in total, and is of
sufficient breadth to provide a general introduction to the chosen
topic, while also exploring relevant topics in depth. EASSS 2013 will be
co-located and run in parallel with the Advanced Course on AI Summer
School 2013, giving students the opportunity to interact with a wide variety of peers.

Further details on the tutorial programme, on how to apply to attend the summer school and on costs will be available shortly. We also expect to have some grants available that students may apply for.

The program will include a student session, for which a separate call
for papers will be available soon.

More specifically, the course is about how to analyze panel data (observed at two or more discrete moments in time) on complete social networks (all the network ties within a set of actors are observed as present or absent, except a moderate amount of missing data). The course will treat the statistical modeling of the dynamics of social networks and of the co-evolution of networks and actors, according to the actor-based approach of SIENA models. Some attention will be given also to non-longitudinal network models, the so-called Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM).
The course will cover both theoretical and practical issues and includes extensive laboratory practice with RSIENA, the implementation of SIENA models in the R environment for statistical computing. For extensive information, materials and references about the statistical analysis of social network dynamics and the SIENA approach see the SIENA website (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/ )

It will provide a beginners’-level introduction to computer programming using examples drawn from social science. It will also introduce key libraries, methodologies, and platforms available for social science programmers.
 
Students will learn the high-level programming language Java. Java was chosen because it is the most in-demand language in industry, and because people who learn the language should have no difficulty picking up other languages.
 
The school offers a unique, hands-on learning experience. Practical work will include building up core social science models, and will introduce students to Spatial Interaction Modelling, Microsimulation, Agent-based modelling, Genetic Algorithms and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, Statistical Analysis and Scientific Visualisation.

IFAAMAS will consider any reasonable proposal for a training event, but typically 3 to 5 days of intensive courses (or tutorials), presented by internationally or regionally recognised speakers, on a variety of topics in the agent systems area, with some 5-15 courses, each of 1/2 day to a day duration.

The two weeks program creates an excellent basis for the advancement of their current research designs.

In the first week we address the key methodological challenges of concept-building, causation/explanation and micro-macro-linkage that occur in almost all research efforts and strive for a clarification of the epistemological implications underlying methodological paradigms. In the second week, these methodological considerations are applied to central empirical fields of research in political science, sociology and their intersections with other disciplines. In this second part of the program participants are assigned to four thematic groups according to their own research topics. The thematic areas cover ""Governance, Politics and Processes of Decision-Making"", ""Citizenship, Migration and Diversity"", ""Social Struggle and Globalization"", and ""Politics, Societies and Institutions under Economic Constraints"".

The course encompasses a varied format of lectures, workshops, seminars, and one-to-one consultations. During the summer school participants will also have the opportunity to present and intensely discuss their own work and approaches and will be provided with hands-on advice for their research designs.

The school brings together a faculty of renowned international and Berlin-based scholars. Among the confirmed international lecturers are Donatella Della Porta (EUI), John Foran (UC Santa Barbara), Marion Fourcade (UC Berkeley), Gary Goertz (University of Notre Dame), Macartan Humphreys (Columbia University), Wendy Olsen (University of Manchester), and Beverly Silver (Johns Hopkins University).

This workshop brings together experts from the social sciences, humanities and behavioural sciences with social simulation specialists and computational model builders. It aims to find solutions to some the issues last year's social.path workshop raised. It will focus on artificial sociality rather than intelligence and tries to address the following two points in particular:
1. The operationalisation of human behaviour in realistic settings (where perfect rationality is not applicable anymore), as well as
2. The Investigation of the interplay of bottom-up and top-down approaches to study complex systems.

This hands-on seven day summer school aims to bring social scientists without any programming experience to the point where they can program their own social science models and applications. It will provide a beginner's-level introduction to computer programming using examples drawn from social science. It will also introduce key libraries, methodologies, and platforms available for social science programmers. 

The emphasis for the school will be on practical, hands-on development of skills, each day building up core programming ideas. Students will learn the high-level programming language Java. Java was chosen because it is the most in-demand language in industry, and because people who learn the language should have no difficulty subsequently picking up other languages. Students will be introduced to general good practice in coding and other aspects of programming. 

Practical work will include building up social science models. Practicals will centre on Agent-Based Modelling, as it is a powerful technique that is nevertheless relatively clear for beginners. However, the course will also introduce students to Spatial Microsimulation, a range of Artificial Intelligence techniques, and Scientific Visualisation. Days four and seven will be ""hacking"" workshops specifically for students to build their own software with advice from experienced staff.",http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/events/computer-programming-for-social-scientists/,Richard,"Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General, Complex Systems",Simsoc,,269

ComMod promotes dialogue, shared learning and collective decision-making, strengthening the adaptive management capacity of communities facing wicked environmental problems. A ComMod approach is iterative and evolves with the participative process whereby stakeholders are involved in the definition and design of the questions, models, simulations and outputs. It involves constant back and forth steps between the model, the field and the negotiation table.
The course will focus on:
- Concepts e.g., wicked problems, socio-ecological systems, complex systems, participatory modelling, simulation strategies.
- Methods and related tools e.g.,: system representation, participatory mapping, model conceptualization, agent-based modelling, role-playing games, participatory simulation and scenario assessment, brainstorming, debriefing and evaluation, facilitation and conflict management.
