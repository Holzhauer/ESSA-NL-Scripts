In particular, we show that there is no loss for the seller in optimizing over mechanisms such that all allocations belong to the boundary of the feasible set. The set of potentially optimal mechanisms can be further restricted when the costs are sufficiently low: the optimal mechanisms use only allocations from the “north-east” boundary of the feasible set and the null allocation.","Gregory Pavlov, University of Western Ontario",http://www.bepress.com/bejte/vol11/iss1/art4/?sending=11350,Richard,,,218,
4/17/2011 9:07:16,Article,Interactive Epistemology and Solution Concepts for Games with Asymmetric Information,"We use an interactive epistemology framework to provide a systematic analysis of some solution concepts for games with asymmetric information. We characterize solution concepts using expressible epistemic assumptions, represented as events in the canonical space generated by primitive uncertainty about the payoff relevant state, payoff irrelevant information, and actions. In most of the paper, we adopt an interim perspective, which is appropriate to analyze genuine incomplete information. We relate Delta-rationalizability (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, Advances in Theoretical Economics 3, 2003) to interim correlated rationalizability (Dekel, Fudenberg and Morris, Theoretical Economics 2, 2007) and to rationalizability in the interim strategic form. We also consider the ex ante perspective, which is appropriate to analyze asymmetric information about an initial chance move. We prove the equivalence between interim correlated rationalizability and an ex ante notion of correlated rationalizability.","Pierpaolo Battigalli, Bocconi University

4/17/2011 9:09:00,Article,The Benefit of Mixing Private Noise into Public Information in Beauty Contest Games,"The authorities often disclose their economic forecasts to the public ambiguously. The more ambiguous the way in which they present the information, the more variously market participants interpret such announcements. Hence, an ambiguous public announcement mixes some private noise to the authorities’ economic forecasts. Using Keynesian beauty contest games, as in Morris and Shin (2002), we find that mixing private noise into public information is often socially beneficial. We also derive the optimal information dissemination policy and find that (i) for a given level of ambiguity, it may be better not to release information, and (ii) if ambiguity can be chosen freely, it is optimal to release the most precise information, but with an appropriate degree of ambiguity.","Hiroki Arato, Tokyo Metropolitan University

4/17/2011 9:10:00,Article,Input Production Joint Venture,"In many industries, it is quite common to observe firms delegating the production of essential inputs to independent ventures jointly established with competing rivals. The diffusion of this arrangement and the favourable stance of competition authorities call for the assessment of the social and private desirability of Input Production Joint Ventures (IPJV), which represent a form of input production cooperation, scantly investigated so far. IPJV can be seen as an intermediate organizational setting lying between the two extremes of vertical integration and vertical separation, with a major difference, due to partial collusion. Our investigation is based on an oligopoly model with horizontally differentiated goods. We characterize the conditions under which IPJV is privately optimal finding that firms' incentives may be welfare detrimental. We also provide a rationale for the empirical relevance of IPJV both in terms of its ability to survive and in terms of disengagement incentives which account for the large number of divorces among members of joint ventures. The stance of the paper as to IPJV is more cautious with respect to the received wisdom of competition authorities and in favour of the wide application of the rule of reason.","Gianpaolo Rossini, University of Bologna

4/17/2011 9:11:04,Article,On the Existence and Social Optimality of Equilibria in a Hotelling Game with Uncertain Demand and Linear-Quadratic Costs,"This paper examines a variant of the Hotelling two-stage mill-pricing duopoly game with “linear-quadratic” transport costs and the uniform customer distribution subject to a random shock. The demand is equally likely to be found anywhere in a fixed interval of feasible product characteristics, with the ex-post differentiation of tastes parametrized to reflect the degree of uncertainty. It turns out that, for uncertainty big enough, the presence of a linear component in the cost function no longer rules out an analytical solution to the game, which is a common problem in spatial competition models. In particular, a subgame-perfect equilibrium is shown to exist in which the firms’ locations approach the socially efficient ones as uncertainty further increases, regardless of the curvature of the cost function. When the demand uncertainty reaches maximum, mill-pricing is equivalent to spatial price discrimination under the most general conditions.","Michal Krol, The University of Manchester",http://www.bepress.com/bejte/vol11/iss1/art7/?sending=11350,Richard,,,218,

We hope this may help us identify ways around barriers to expert participation.

The survey is anonymous and should take about 10 min to complete. It consists of a short introduction, followed by two main sections in which we contrast shared perceptions and personal motivation, and a final section where you can tell us more about yourself.

We have found that this dependence is far from trivial. Additionally, for both stochastic and deterministic dynamics we have also found that there is a strong dependence on the initial composition of the population. This hints at the existence of several different mechanisms that could promote or hinder cluster expansion.

4/29/2011 18:16:24,Working Paper,The Emergence of Homogeneous Norms in Heterogeneous Populations,"Social norms are known to establish social order and cohesion if actors commonly agree on them. In heterogeneous populations, however, normative conflict may result and social order may collapse. In this article, we show by means of a computational simulation model that homogeneous social norms may even come about in heterogeneous societies consisting of groups with competing interests. We demonstrate that punishment oriented at conformity can set off enforcement cascades leading to one generally accepted norm. In our model, agents put pressure on others to perform the same public behavior as they show themselves, even if they privately disapprove it. Interestingly, this type of punishment is more effective to form norms than pressuring others to meet their own private preferences. We conclude that group pressure and punishment may be interrelated phenomena, which can lead to homogeneous behaviors even in well diversified societies.","Dirk Helbing, Wenjian Yu, Karl-Dieter Opp, Heiko Rauhut",http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/6917afae5bcdbed7da6a2c8bf77bd9e8/,Sascha,"Reputation, Societal Transition",,219,

If the public goods game, i.e. the experimental paradigm of the tragedy of the commons, offers the opportunity to punish (the ‘stick’), contributions to the public pool usually increase. Direct rewarding (the ‘carrot’) has been shown to be less effective. If, however, the social dilemma is embedded in a richer context, in which either a good reputation for cooperativeness or mutual rewarding independently pays, cooperation in the PG game may be sustained at high levels. Yet, the proposed mechanisms vary in their efficiency and whether or not in the framework, which combines the stick with the carrot; punishment is strongly reduced compared to just having the punishment option.

5/11/2011 17:55:58,Article,Is cooperation viable in mobile organisms? Simple Walk Away rule favors the evolution of cooperation in groups,"The evolution of cooperation through partner choice mechanisms is often thought to involve relatively complex cognitive abilities. Using agent-based simulations, I model a simple partner choice rule, the “Walk Away” rule, where individuals stay in groups that provide higher returns (by virtue of having more cooperators), and “Walk Away” from groups providing low returns. Implementing this conditional movement rule in a public goods game leads to a number of interesting findings: (a) cooperators have a selective advantage when thresholds are high, corresponding to low tolerance for defectors, (b) high thresholds lead to high initial rates of movement and low final rates of movement (after selection), and (c) as cooperation is selected, the population undergoes a spatial transition from high migration (and many small and ephemeral groups) to low migration (and large and stable groups). These results suggest that the very simple “Walk Away” rule of leaving uncooperative groups can favor the evolution of cooperation and that cooperation can evolve in populations in which individuals are able to move in response to local social conditions. A diverse array of organisms are able to leave degraded physical or social environments. The ubiquitous nature of conditional movement suggests that “Walk Away” dynamics may play an important role in the evolution of social behavior in both cognitively complex and cognitively simple organisms.",C.

The model accounts for spatial and social effects (including threshold effects, homophily, and conformity) and media influences. Preliminary simulations demonstrate how such a model could be used to identify nonlinear interactions among potential leverage points, inform policies affecting PHEV market penetration, and help identify future data collection necessary to more accurately model the system. We examine sensitivity of the model to gasoline prices, to accuracy in estimation of fuel costs, to agent willingness to adopt the PHEV technology, to PHEV purchase price and rebates, to PHEV battery range, and to heuristic values related to gasoline usage. Our simulations indicate that PHEV market penetration could be enhanced significantly by providing consumers with ready estimates of expected lifetime fuel costs associated with different vehicles (e.g., on vehicle stickers), and that increases in gasoline prices could nonlinearly magnify the impact on fleet efficiency. We also infer that a potential synergy from a gasoline tax with proceeds is used to fund research into longer-range lower-cost PHEV batteries.","Margaret J. Eppsteina, David K. Groverb, Jeffrey S.

They help provide high organizational performance and innovative capacity. in today's knowledge intense corporations, and this means that organizations must manage the networks strategically. Despite the fact that practitioners are aware of the huge influence of informal communication on decision making, little is known about the underlying principles of efficient employee network collaboration, which is dynamic in nature, especially for complex environments resulting from steady innovation and high competitive pressure. We addressed this issue from a complexity perspective, using an agent based simulation to visualize the key elements of efficient, information-based, collaborative decision making. Our findings suggested that information and communication technologies (ICT) may not be able to leverage corporate performance of the increasingly complex adaptive organizations. There seem to be elementary natural constraints on the cognitive capacities of people dealing with and managing information. Rather than a better technical approach, a more ecologic one is therefore advocated as the best way to improve decision making.","Herbert Simon, Berd-Mathias Adlerb, Walter Baetsc  and Reinhard König",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2011.04.002,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Social Networks",,220,

As a specific feature, a large degree of rectangularity is observed in all networks, with link angle distributions approximately described by stretched exponential functions.

5/13/2011 11:05:52,Article,The geometry of chaotic dynamics - a complex network perspective,"Recently, several complex network approaches to time series analysis have been developed and applied to study a wide range of model systems as well as real-world data, e.g., geophysical or financial time series. Among these techniques, recurrence-based concepts and prominently epsilon-recurrence networks, most faithfully represent the geometrical fine structure of the attractors underlying chaotic (and less interestingly non-chaotic) time series. In this paper we demonstrate that the well known graph theoretical properties local clustering coefficient and global (network) transitivity can meaningfully be exploited to define two new local and two new global measures of dimension in phase space: local upper and lower clustering dimension as well as global upper and lower transitivity dimension. Rigorous analytical as well as numerical results for self-similar sets and simple chaotic model systems suggest that these measures are well-behaved in most non-pathological situations and that they can be estimated reasonably well using epsilon-recurrence networks constructed from relatively short time series. Moreover, we study the relationship between clustering and transitivity dimensions on the one hand, and traditional measures like pointwise dimension or local Lyapunov dimension on the other hand. We also provide further evidence that the local clustering coefficients, or equivalently the local clustering dimensions, are useful for identifying unstable periodic orbits and other dynamically invariant objects from time series. Our results demonstrate that epsilon-recurrence networks exhibit an important link between dynamical systems and graph theory.","R. V. Donner, J. Heitzig, J. F. Donges, Y. Zou, N. Marwan1 and J.

In this paper, we propose an agent-based conceptual and computational model of consumer decision-making based on culture, personality and human needs. It serves as a model for individual behavior in models that investigate system-level resulting behavior. Theoretical concepts operationalized in the model are the Power Distance dimension of Hofstede’s model of national culture; Extroversion, Agreeableness and Openness of Costa and McCrae’s five-factor model of personality, and social status and social responsibility needs. These factors are used to formulate the utility function, process and update the agent state, need recognition and action estimation modules of the consumer decision process. The model was validated against data on culture, personality, wealth and car purchasing from eleven European countries. It produces believable results for the differences of consumer purchasing across eleven European countries.","Omid Roozmanda, Nasser Ghasem-Aghaeea, Gert Jan Hofstedeb, Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsha, Ahmad Baraania and Tim Verwaart",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2011.05.001,Sascha,Market Dynamics,,220,Knowledge-Based Systems

Social networks provide a powerful abstraction of the structure and dynamics of diverse kinds of people or people-to-technology interaction. These social network systems are usually characterized by the complex network structures and rich accompanying contextual information. Recent trends also indicate the usage of complex network as a key feature for next generation usage and exploitation of the Web. This journal is focused on the foundations of social networks as well as case studies, empirical, and other methodological works related to the computational tools for the automatic discovery of Web-based social networks. This Journal provides an opportunity to compare and contrast the ethological approach to social behaviour in animals (including the study of animal tracks and learning by members of the same species) with web-based evidence of social interaction, perceptual learning, information granulation, the behaviour of humans and affinities between web-based social networks. The main topics cover the design and use of various computational intelligence tools and software, simulations of social networks, representation and analysis of social networks, use of semantic networks in the design and community-based research issues such as knowledge discovery, privacy and protection, and visualization.
We solicit original research and technical papers not published elsewhere. The papers can be theoretical, practical and application, and cover a broad set of intelligent methods, with particular emphasis on Social Network computing.","Editor-in-Chief

The defined ED model is a pure Agent-Based Model, formed entirely of the rules governing the behavior of the individual agents which populate the system. Two distinct types of agents have been identified, active and passive. Active agents represent human actors, meanwhile passive agents represent services and other reactive systems. The actions of agents and the communication between them will be represented using Moore state machines extended to include probabilistic transitions. The model also includes the environment in which agents move and interact. With the aim of verifying the proposed model an initial simulation has been created using NetLogo, an agent-based simulation environment well suited for modeling complex systems.","Manel Taboada, Eduardo Cabrera, Ma Luisa Iglesias, Francisco Epelde and Emilio Luque",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.203,Sascha,,,221,Procedia Computer Science

The network consists of N interacting agents, whose connectivity structure is dynamic, governed by a rewiring process controlled by the actual network state. With the aid of damage spreading techniques we show how the dynamical stability of these models can be largely enhanced by self-organized feedback loops between the network topology and the intrinsic network dynamics.

We first show that the prevalence of an oppositional culture in the minority group cannot always be sustained in equilibrium. Indeed, because the size of the majority group is larger, there is an “imposed” process of exposition to role models from the majority group that favors the diffusion of mainstream values in the minority community. In spite of this, an oppositional culture in the minority group can nevertheless be sustained in steady state if there is enough cultural segmentation in terms of role models, or if the size of the minority group is large enough, or if the degree of oppositional identity it implies is high enough. We also demonstrate that the higher the level of harassment and the number of racist individuals in the society, the more likely an oppositional minority culture will emerge. We finally show that ethnic identity and socialization effort can be more intense in mixed rather than segregated neighborhoods.","Alberto Bisin, Eleonora Patacchini, Thierry Verdier and Yves Zenou",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.04.009,Sascha,Societal Transition,,221,European Economic Review

At the global scale, the use of quantitative models has always underpinned research into the biophysical and biogeochemical processes of environmental change. Human dimensions research, however, tends to focus on defining ‘frameworks’ rather than developing quantitative models and whilst there are now many examples of socio-ecological systems models at local and landscape scales (e.g. see Grimm et al., 2005), there are very few examples at global scales. Yet, human induced changes are well known to affect the earth system in a variety of ways through processes that operate over many different temporal and spatial scales ([McGuire et al., 2001], [Piao et al., 2007], [Pitman et al., 2009] and Pongratz et al., 2009 J.

This paper argues that perceptions could change if the systematic design of experiments (DOE) for simulation research was fully realized. DOE can increase (1) the transparency of simulation model behavior and (2) the effectiveness of reporting simulation results. Based on DOE principles, we develop a systematic procedure to guide the analysis of simulation models as well as concrete templates for sharing the results. A simulation model investigating the performance of learning algorithms in an economic mechanism design context illustrates our suggestions. Overall, the proposed systematic procedure for applying DOE principles complements current initiatives for a more standardized simulation research process.","Lorscheid, I., Heine, B.-O. and Meyer, M.",http://www.tu-harburg.de/alt/sdw/research/research-papers.html,Other,ABM methodical,,222,Management@TUHH Research Paper Series

6/10/2011 12:23:55,Article,Adjustment of Knowledge-Connection Structure Affects the Performance of Knowledge Transfer ,"The influences of the network properties on the transfer of knowledge within the network have been extensively studied. However, the “knowledge” properties of the network are largely neglected in literature. In this paper we investigate whether the performance of knowledge transfer in a network can be influenced by adjusting the “knowledge-connection” structure of that network, as a primitive attempt to study knowledge transfer from the aspect of the “knowledge” properties of the network. By the “knowledge-connection” structure we mean the network structure that describes the knowledge distribution within the network. Therefore, the agent-based modeling approach is adopted in this paper to compare the performance of knowledge transfer in a series of networks which differ from one another in their “knowledge-connection” structures. The results of computational simulations illustrate that the network adjustment to increase the knowledge diversity in the directly-connected agent-pairs is helpful for improving the overall performance of knowledge transfer in the entire network in the short term; but the improvement of the long-term performance is less significant. Especially, if the local knowledge-exchange follows the mutually-advantageous bidirectional-knowledge-diffusion (BKD) model, the proposed network adjustment would instead hamper the long-term effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Further investigations show that the limitations can be overcome by adopting a periodical re-adjustment mechanism, through which the knowledge diversity in the network is maintained and persistent knowledge flow becomes possible.","Zhaoguo Xuan, Haoxiang Xia and Yanyan Du",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2011.05.054,Sascha,Social Networks,,222,Expert Systems with Applications

6/17/2011 9:56:05,Article,A Quantitative Test of Hamilton's Rule for the Evolution of Altruism,"The evolution of altruism is a fundamental and enduring puzzle in biology. In a seminal paper Hamilton showed that altruism can be selected for when rb - c>0, where c is the fitness cost to the altruist, b is the fitness benefit to the beneficiary, and r is their genetic relatedness. While many studies have provided qualitative support for Hamilton's rule, quantitative tests have not yet been possible due to the difficulty of quantifying the costs and benefits of helping acts. Here we use a simulated system of foraging robots to experimentally manipulate the costs and benefits of helping and determine the conditions under which altruism evolves. By conducting experimental evolution over hundreds of generations of selection in populations with different c/b ratios, we show that Hamilton's rule always accurately predicts the minimum relatedness necessary for altruism to evolve. This high accuracy is remarkable given the presence of pleiotropic and epistatic effects as well as mutations with strong effects on behavior and fitness (effects not directly taken into account in Hamilton's original 1964 rule). In addition to providing the first quantitative test of Hamilton's rule in a system with a complex mapping between genotype and phenotype, these experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of kin selection theory.","Markus Waibel, Dario Floreano, Laurent Keller",http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000615,Sascha,Societal Transition,,223,PLoS Biol

From the numerical simulations we show that there are successive updates which are similar to avalanches in many self-organized criticality systems when a perturbation is imposed. We find that the distribution of avalanche size satisfies the finite-size scaling (FSS) ansatz on two-dimensional lattices and random networks. However, on scale-free networks with the degree exponent y <= 3 we show that the avalanche size distribution does not satisfy the FSS ansatz. The results indicate that the disordered configurations on two-dimensional lattices or on random networks are still stable against the perturbation in the limit N (network size) > infinity. However, on scale-free networks with y <=3 the perturbation always drives the disordered phase into an ordered phase. The possible relationship between the properties of phase transition of the Axelrod model and the avalanche distribution is also discussed.","Yup Kim, Minsoo Cho and Soon-Hyung Yook",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2011.06.020,Sascha,"Social Networks, Societal Transition",,224,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications

The model allows us to test the effects of multiple assumptions about the behaviors of individual agents as they respond to different incentives introduced by BRT policy changes, such as the implementation of exclusive bus lanes, increased bus frequency, pre-boarding ticket machines and express stops, separately and together. We find that, under our assumptions, these policies can result in significant improvements in terms of individual journey times, modal shift, and length of rush hour. We see that the addition of an exclusive bus lane results in significant improvements for both car users and bus riders. Informed with appropriate empirical data relating to the behavior of individual agents, the geography and the specific policy interventions, the model has the potential to aid policymakers in examining the effectiveness of different BRT schemes, applied to broader environments.",Simon McDonnell and Moira Zellner,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2011.05.003,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Societal Transition",,224,Transport Policy

In this paper, we describe SimAmph, an agent-based simulation model for exploring how individual perceptions, peer influences and subcultural settings shape the use of psychostimulants and related harm amongst young Australians.
We present the conceptual architecture underpinning SimAmph, the assumptions we made in building it, the outcomes of sensitivity analysis of key model parameters and the results obtained when we modelled a baseline scenario.
SimAmph's core behavioural algorithm is able to produce social patterns of partying and recreational drug use that approximate those found in an Australian national population survey. We also discuss the limitations involved in running closed-system simulations and how the model could be refined to include the social, as well as health, consequences of drug use.
SimAmph provides a useful tool for integrating diverse data and exploring drug policy scenarios. Its integrated approach goes some way towards overcoming the compartmentalisation that characterises existing data, and its structure, parameters and values can be modified as new data and understandings emerge. In a companion paper (Dray et al., 2011), we use the model outlined here to explore the possible consequences of two policy scenarios.","Pascal Perez, Anne Dray, David Moore, Paul Dietze, Gabriele Bammer, Rebecca Jenkinson, Christine Siokou, Rachael Green, Susan L.

Marketing phenomena that are too complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches can often be modeled using this approach. Agent-based modeling investigates aggregate phenomena by simulating the behavior of individual “agents,” such as consumers or organizations. Some useful examples of agent-based modeling have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement using a rigorous agent-based approach.",William Rand and Roland T.

In the second simulation, our modelling showed that the mass-media prevention campaign had little effect on the behaviour and experience of heavier drug users. However, it led to reductions in the prevalence of health-related conditions amongst moderate drug users and prevented them from becoming heavier users.
Agent-based modelling has great potential as a tool for exploring the reciprocal relationships between environments and individuals, and for highlighting how intended changes in one domain of a system may produce unintended consequences in other domains.

We applied the model to land plots that have been enrolled in China's Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP) to examine reenrollment in an alternative payment program when the current payments ceased. The study was conducted in Wolong Nature Reserve where several thousand plant and animal species, including giant pandas, may benefit from the reenrollment. We found that over 15% more GTGP land can be reenrolled at the same payment if social norms were leveraged by allowing more than 10 rounds of interactions among landholders regarding their reenrollment decisions. With only three rounds of interactions, an additional 7.5% GTGP land was reenrolled at the same payment due to the effects of social norms. In addition, the effects of social norms were largest at intermediate payments and were smaller at much higher or much smaller payments. Even in circumstances where frequent interactions among landholders about their enrollment decisions are not feasible, policy arrangements that divide households into multiple waves for sequential enrollment can enroll over 11% more land at a given payment level. The approach presented in this paper can be used to improve the efficiency of existing PES programs and many other conservation investments worldwide.","Xiaodong Chen, Frank Lupi, Li An, Ryan Sheely, Andrés Viña and Jianguo Liu",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.06.007,Sascha,"Policy, Societal Transition",,227,Ecological Modelling

It is well known that younger individuals interact with one another and society as a whole more than older individuals, suggesting that this could account for the skewed prevalence. However, the observed skewed disease prevalence could also be due to a lesser biological vulnerability (cross-immunity or partial immunity) in the older generation. We develop an age-structured, compartmental mathematical model to quantify the degree to which the skewed disease prevalence among younger individuals is due to a lesser biological vulnerability in the older generation. The model incorporates synthetic data regarding sociological interaction between different age groups generated from the simulation software EpiSims, which allows a clear distinction of the sociological and biological susceptibility effects on the transmission rate of the disease. After fitting the model to available data, we quantify the degree of biological susceptibility of five age groups in the population of the United States. Our model indicates that individuals over the age of 60 are 1/15 as susceptible to H1N1/09 influenza as those under 30 years of age.

The first is the presence of endogenous sorting which confounds the effects of social influence and social selection on individual attainment. The second is how to account for the local network dependencies through which peer effects influence individual behavior. We empirically address these problems using longitudinal data on academic performance, friendship, and advice seeking relations among students in a full-time graduate academic program. We specify stochastic agent-based models that permit estimation of the interdependent contribution of social selection and social influence to individual performance. We report evidence of peer effects. Students tend to assimilate the average performance of their friends and of their advisors. At the same time, students attaining similar levels of academic performance are more likely to develop friendship and advice ties. Together, these results imply that processes of social influence and social selection are sub-components of a more general a co-evolutionary process linking network structure and individual behavior.

In the absence of any reliable model for generating weighted social networks, we attribute weights to links in a few ways supported by empirical data ranging from totally uncorrelated to weighted bipartite networks. The results of the extensive simulation work on standard complex network models show that, except in a case that does not seem to be common in social networks, taking the tie strength into account does not change in a radical manner the long-run steady-state behavior of the studied games. Besides model networks, we also included a real-life case drawn from a coauthorship network. In this case also, taking the weights into account only changes the results slightly with respect to the raw unweighted graph, although to draw more reliable conclusions on real social networks many more cases should be studied as these weighted networks become available.","Pierre Buesser, Jorge Peña, Enea Pestelacci and Marco Tomassini",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2011.07.021,Sascha,"Social Networks, Societal Transition",,227,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications

A plausible model parameter space is discretized and sampled by a particle swarm where the particle locations represent unique model parameter sets. Particle locations are optimized based on a model performance metric using a standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Locations producing a performance metric below a specified threshold are collected. In subsequent visits to the location, a modified value of the performance metric, proportionally increased above the acceptable threshold (i.e. convexities in the response surface become concavities), is provided to the PSO algorithm. As a result, the methodology promotes a global exploration of a plausible parameter space, and discourages, but does not prevent, reinvestigation of previously explored regions. This effectively alters the strategy of the PSO algorithm from optimization to a sampling approach providing global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. [...]",Dylan R. Harp and Velimir V.

Previous works analyze the relationship between inequality and environmental quality in a static setting. This paper builds a dynamic model more suitable to analyze technological externalities driven by the emergence of a new demand for green products. Under fairly general assumptions on technology and preferences, we show that: 1. the relationship between inequality and environmental innovation is highly non-linear and crucially depends on per-capita income; 2. an excessive inequality harms the development of environmental technologies especially in rich countries. Key to our results is the fact that externalities generated by pioneer consumers of green products benefit the entire population only for relatively low income distances. The empirical analysis robustly confirms our theoretical results, that is: whereas for rich countries inequality negatively affects the diffusion of innovations, per-capita income is paramount in poorer ones.",Francesco Vona and Fabrizio Patriarca,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.027,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Societal Transition",,227,Ecological Economics
8/19/2011 17:09:37,Article,An extensible simulation environment and movement metrics for testing walking behavior in agent-based models,"Human movement is a significant ingredient of many social, environmental, and technical systems, yet the importance of movement is often discounted in considering systems’ complexity. Movement is commonly abstracted in agent-based modeling (which is perhaps the methodological vehicle for modeling complex systems), despite the influence of movement upon information exchange and adaptation in a system. In particular, agent-based models of urban pedestrians often treat movement in proxy form at the expense of faithfully treating movement behavior with realistic agency. There exists little consensus about which method is appropriate for representing movement in agent-based schemes. In this paper, we examine popularly-used methods to drive movement in agent-based models, first by introducing a methodology that can flexibly handle many representations of movement at many different scales and second, introducing a suite of tools to benchmark agent movement between models and against real-world trajectory data. We find that most popular movement schemes do a relatively poor job of representing movement, but that some schemes may well be “good enough” for some applications. We also discuss potential avenues for improving the representation of movement in agent-based frameworks.","Paul M. Torrens, Atsushi Nara, Xun Li, Haojie Zhu, William A. Griffin and Scott B.

This builds on and develops previous coevolutionary analyses of long-term technological and industrial change, and recent renewed interest within ecological economics on coevolutionary approaches. Previous work has analysed how the coevolution of technologies and institutions has led to the lock-in of current high-carbon energy systems; and how the coevolution of physical and social technologies and business strategies has brought significant material and welfare benefits to the minority of the world's population living in industrialised countries. The coevolutionary framework proposed here may be used to undertake: (1) detailed empirical analyses at a micro–meso level of the challenges relating to the innovation and adoption of particularly low-carbon technologies; (2) as a framework for analysing the multi-level interaction of social and technological elements within potential transition pathways to a low carbon energy system; (3) to assess the implications for economic growth and prosperity of a transition to a low carbon economy; and (4) to assist in the development of more formal, multi-level evolutionary economic models.",Timothy J.

In this paper a threshold model of social contagion, originally proposed in the network science literature, is presented to characterize this social influence in the evacuation decision making process. Initiated by a single agent, the condition of a cascade when a portion of the population decides to evacuate has been derived from the model. Simulation models are also developed to investigate the effects of community mixing patterns and the initial seed on cascade propagation and the effect of previous time-steps considered by the agents and the strength of ties on average cascade size. Insights related to social influence include the significant role of mixing patterns among communities in the network and the role of the initial seed on cascade propagation.

9/20/2011 13:38:35,Article,Evolution of altruistic punishment in heterogeneous populations,"Evolutionary models for altruistic behavior typically make the assumption of homogeneity: each individual has the same costs and benefits associated with cooperating with each other and punishing for selfish behavior. In this paper, we relax this assumption by separating the population into heterogeneous classes, such that individuals from different classes differ in their ability to punish for selfishness. We compare the effects of introducing heterogeneity this way across two population models, that each represents a different type of population: the infinite and well-mixed population describes the way workers of social insects such as ants are organized, while a spatially structured population is more related to the way social norms evolve and are maintained in a social network.
We find that heterogeneity in the effectiveness of punishment by itself has little to no effect on whether or not altruistic behavior will stabilize in a population. In contrast, heterogeneity in the cost that individuals pay to punish for selfish behavior allows altruistic behavior to be maintained more easily. Fewer punishers are needed to deter selfish behavior, and the individuals that punish will mostly belong to the class that pays a lower cost to do so. This effect is amplified when individuals that pay a lower cost for punishing inflict a higher punishment.
The two population models differ when individuals that pay a low cost for punishing also inflict a lower punishment. In this situation, altruistic behavior becomes harder to maintain in an infinite and well-mixed population. However, this effect does not occur when the population is spatially structured.","Harmen de Weerd, Rineke Verbrugge",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.08.034,Sascha,"Social Conflict, Social Networks, Societal Transition, Complex Systems",,229,Journal of Theoretical Biology

This paper presents a model for agents' behaviour in counterflow situations, where they try to avoid collisions with oncoming agents. In the model, the agents observe the walking directions of the agents in front of them and choose their own actions accordingly. We implement the model to the widely used social force model, which describes the the motion of each agent in a Newtonian manner. Nevertheless, the basic idea of the counterflow model can be used with various modelling platforms. We study the e_ects of the model's parameters with Monte Carlo simulations and justify our selection of their values.

9/20/2011 13:57:26,Article,Hybrid agent-based simulation for policy evaluation of solar power generation systems,"To encourage the adoption of solar power as well as new technological improvements in solar industry, state and federal governments have employed various kinds of incentives over the past decades, such as rebates, tax return opportunities, and Net Metering credits. At the same time, however, the governments concern regulations to avoid highly steep growth of solar energy without considering necessary supporting structure such as storage components, which will increase the electricity price and threaten the stability of existing transmission systems. The goal of this research is to develop a decision support tool to analyze the effectiveness of various policies (both incentives as well as regulations) on the proper growth rate of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems avoiding the instability of the transition system or steep rising of the electricity price. To this end, we propose a hybrid two-level simulation modeling framework, which is significantly more detailed than the simplified structures commonly used in most policy evaluations. The lower-level model concerns the calculation of PV system payback period of individual household based on hourly electricity generation (PV) and consumptions, incentive levels, PV module price, and hourly electricity price (grid). The higher-level model, running on a weekly basis for 20 years, concerns the household adoption behaviors of the PV systems influenced by various factors, including payback period, household income, word-of-mouth effect and advertisement effect. Agent-based and system dynamics modeling techniques are leveraged in both levels. The proposed models have been developed for residential areas at two different regions in the US based on real data, which have been used to illustrate the impact of policies in different regions.","Jiayun Zhao, Esfandyar Mazhari, Nurcin Celik.

Understanding how such systems demonstrate resilience by absorbing or recovering from major external perturbations requires both quantitative foundations and a multidisciplinary view of the topic. This book demonstrates how new methods can be used to identify the actions favouring the recovery from perturbations on a variety of examples including the dynamics of bacterial biofilms, grassland savannahs, language competition and Internet social networking sites. The reader is taken through an introduction to the idea of resilience and viability and shown the mathematical basis of the techniques used to analyse systems. The idea of individual or agent-based modelling of complex systems is introduced and related to analytically tractable approximations of such models. A set of case studies illustrates the use of the techniques in real applications, and the final section describes how one can use new software tools for carrying out the necessary calculations. The book is intended for a general scientific audience of readers from the natural and social sciences, although it requires some mathematics to gain a full understanding of the more theoretical chapters. It is an essential point of reference for those interested in the practical application of the concepts of resilience and viability.","Deffuant, Guillaume and Gilbert, Nigel (Eds.)",http://www.springer.com/social+sciences/book/978-3-642-20422-7,Sascha,Complex Systems,,229,Series: Understanding Complex Systems

Here we reexamine this assumption by investigating the evolution of cooperation in spatial social dilemma games, where instead of pure strategies players can adopt emotional profiles of their neighbors. For simplicity, the emotional profile of each player is determined by two pivotal factors only, namely how it behaves towards less and how towards more successful neighbors. We find that imitating emotions such as goodwill and envy instead of pure strategies from the more successful players reestablishes imitation as a tour de force for resolving social dilemmas on structured populations without any additional assumptions or strategic complexity.

Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities.

In the model, the informal sector emerges as a result of rural–urban migration decisions of heterogeneous agents subject to social influence in the form of neighboring effects of varying strengths. Besides using a multinomial logit choice model that allows for agent idiosyncrasy, explicit agent heterogeneity is introduced in the form of socio-demographic characteristics preferred by modern-sector employers. We find that different combinations of the strength of social influence and the socio-economic composition of the workforce lead to very different urbanization and urban informal sector shares. In particular, moderate levels of social influence and a large proportion of rural inhabitants with preferred socio-demographic characteristics are conducive to a higher urbanization rate and a larger informal sector.","César García-Díaz, Ana I.

9/30/2011 10:48:40,Article,Multi-agent knowledge integration mechanism using particle swarm optimization,"Unstructured group decision-making is burdened with several central difficulties: unifying the knowledge of multiple experts in an unbiased manner and computational inefficiencies. In addition, a proper means of storing such unified knowledge for later use has not yet been established. Storage difficulties stem from of the integration of the logic underlying multiple experts' decision-making processes and the structured quantification of the impact of each opinion on the final product. To address these difficulties, this paper proposes a novel approach called the multiple agent-based knowledge integration mechanism (MAKIM), in which a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is used as a knowledge representation and storage vehicle. In this approach, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to adjust causal relationships and causality coefficients from the perspective of global optimization. Once an optimized FCM is constructed an agent based model (ABM) is applied to the inference of the FCM to solve real world problem. The final aggregate knowledge is stored in FCM form and is used to produce proper inference results for other target problems. To test the validity of our approach, we applied MAKIM to a real-world group decision-making problem, an IT project risk assessment, and found MAKIM to be statistically robust.","Kun Chang Lee, Namho Lee, Habin Lee",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2011.08.004,Sascha,"ABM technical, ABM methodical",,230,Technological Forecasting and Social Change

The model incorporates the actions of heterogeneous housing consumers, developers, and farmer/landowners who make economic decisions in land and housing markets. The model allows for population growth and simulates the evolution of land use patterns and prices over a 20-year time period. Zoning regulations in the form of minimum lot size restrictions imposed in an outlying area are shown to have effects that vary with the stringency of the regulations: 2-acre minimum lot sizes have little effect on the spatial patterns of development, but they do increase land and housing prices and result in higher incomes in the region; 5-acre minimum lot sizes push development toward the city center, leaving agricultural land in the zoned region undeveloped until quite late in the simulation period. While house prices are higher with 5-acre zoning, land prices in the zoned region fall, highlighting the countervailing influences of lot size restrictions on land prices. The new modeling approach allows for the tracking of the transitional dynamics of development, both over space and time as the urban area grows.","Nicholas Magliocca, Virginia McConnell, Margaret Walls, Elena Safirova",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2011.08.012,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Complex Systems",,230,Regional Science and Urban Economics

It is further assessed how well the models capture real world mechanisms and how this is motivated. It is concluded that models addressing the full extent of transitions suffer from a weak micro-foundation and empirical validation, which is largely due to the scope of transitions and the fragmented theoretical basis of transition research.

We show that these phenomena can be a direct consequence of simple imitation and internal conflicts between ‘cooperators’ and ‘defectors’. We employ a game-theoretic model of dynamic network formation where successful individuals are more likely to be imitated by newcomers who adopt their strategies and copy their social network. We find that, despite using the same mechanism, cooperators promote well-connected highly prosperous networks and defectors cause the network to fragment and lose its prosperity; defectors are unable to maintain the highly connected networks they invade. Once the network is fragmented it can be reconstructed by a new invasion of cooperators, leading to the cycle of formation and fragmentation seen, for example, in bacterial communities and socio-economic networks. In this endless struggle between cooperators and defectors we observe that cooperation leads to prosperity, but prosperity is associated with instability.

Along with this trace, we examine how these origins have motivated different concepts and designs of agents in ACE, which starts from the early work on simple programmed agents, randomly-behaving agents, zero-intelligence agents, human-written programmed agents, autonomous agents, and empirically calibrated agents, and extends to the newly-developing cognitive agents, psychological agents, and culturally sensitive agents. The review also shows that the intellectual ideas underlying these varieties of agents cross several disciplines, which may be considered as part of a general attempt to study humans (and their behavior) with an integrated interdisciplinary foundation.",Shu-heng Chen,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2011.09.003,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, ABM methodical",,230,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
9/30/2011 17:07:20,Article,A scalable multiagent system architecture for interactive applications,"Interactive applications like crowd simulations need to properly render the virtual world while simulating the interaction of thousands of agents at the same time. The computational workload generated by these two tasks highly increases with the number simulated agents, requiring a scalable design of the multiagent system. In this paper we present, in an unified manner, a distributed multiagent system architecture that can manage large crowds of autonomous agents at interactive rates while rendering multiple views of the virtual world being simulated. This architecture consists of a distributed multiagent system and a complementary distributed visualization subsystem. We also present a new scalability study of the distributed multiagent system architecture, as well as an application example. The scalability study shows that, since no system bottlenecks are present in the proposed multiagent system architecture, it can efficiently simulate population sizes of different orders of magnitude by simply adding more hardware, provided that the ratio of clients per server is appropriate for the computer platforms acting as servers. On other hand, the application example shows that these improvements are achieved without affecting the interactivity of the simulation. Therefore, the scalability of the proposed multiagent system architecture is validated for interactive large-scale applications.",Guillermo Vigueras and Juan M.

9/30/2011 17:11:37,Article,Feedback loops and types of adaptation in the modelling of land-use decisions in an agent-based simulation,"A key challenge of land-use modelling for supporting sustainable land management is to understand how environmental feedback that emerges from land-use actions can reshape land-use decisions in the long term. To investigate this issue, we apply the Human–Environment System framework formulated by Scholz (2011) as a conceptual guide to read typical feedback loops in land-use systems. We use an agent-based land-use change model (LUDAS) developed by [37] and [36] to test the sensitivity of long-term land-use dynamics to the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning with respect to different system performance indicators at different levels of aggregation. Simulation experiments were based on a case study that was carried out in the Hong Ha watershed (Vietnam). We specified two model versions that represent two mechanisms of human adaptation in land-use decisions to environmental changes that emerged from land-use actions. The first mechanism includes only primary feedback loop learning, i.e. households adapt to the annual change in socio-ecological conditions and direct environmental response to land-use activities. The second mechanism includes the first one and secondary feedback loop learning, in which households can change their behavioural model in response to changes in socio-ecological conditions at the landscape-community level in the longer term. Spatial-temporal patterns of land-use and interrelated community income changes driven from the two feedback mechanisms are compared in order to evaluate the added value of the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning. The results demonstrate that the effect of the added secondary feedback loop learning on land-use dynamics depends on domain type, time scale, and aggregation level of the impact indicators.","Quang Bao Le, Roman Seidl, Roland W.

Modeling opinion exchange and diffusion across landscapes often involves the simulation of large numbers of geographically located individual decision-makers and a massive number of individual-level interactions. This simulation requires substantial computational power. GPU-enabled computing resources provide a massively parallel processing platform based on a fine-grained shared memory paradigm. This massively parallel processing platform holds considerable promise for meeting the computing requirement of agent-based models of spatial problems. In this article, we focus on the parallelization of an agent-based spatial opinion model using GPU technologies. We discussed key algorithms designed for parallel agent-based opinion modeling: including domain decomposition and mutual exclusion. Experiments conducted to examine computing performance show that GPUs provide a computationally efficient alternative to traditional parallel computing architectures and substantially accelerate agent-based models of large-scale opinion exchange among individual decision makers.",Wenwu Tang and David A.

9/30/2011 17:17:14,Article,An agent based model to simulate structural and land use changes in agricultural systems of the argentine pampas,"The Argentine Pampas, one of the main agricultural areas in the world, recently has undergone significant changes in land use and structural characteristics of agricultural production systems. Concerns about the environmental and societal impacts of the changes motivated development of an agent-based model (ABM) to gain insight on processes underlying recent observed patterns. The model is described following a standard protocol (ODD). Results are discussed for an initial set of simplified simulations performed to understand the processes that generated and magnified the changes in the Pampas. Changes in the structure of agricultural production and land tenure seem to be driven by differences among farmers’ ability to generate sufficient agricultural income to remain in business. In turn, as no off-farm or credit is modeled, economic sustainability is tied to initial resource endowment (area cropped). Farmers operating small areas are economically unviable and must lease out their farms to farmers operating larger areas. This leads to two patterns: (a) a concentration of production (fewer farmers operating larger areas) and, (b) an increase in the area operated by tenants. The simulations showed an increase of soybean area, linked to the higher profitability of this crop. Despite the stylized nature of initial simulations, all emerging patterns are highly consistent with changes observed in the Pampas.","Federico E. Bert, Guillermo P. Podestá, Santiago L.

Recent existing reseach evidence indicates a limited effect of opinion leaders on diffusion processes, yet these studies take into account merely the network position of opinion leaders without addressing their influential power. Empirical findings of our study show that opinion leaders, in addition to having a more central network
position, possess more accurate knowledge about a product and tend to be less susceptible to norms and more innovative. Experiments that address these attributes, using an agent-based model, demonstrate that opinion leaders increase the speed of the information stream and the adoption process itself. Furthermore, they increase the maximum adoption percentage. These results indicate that targeting opinion leaders remains a valuable marketing strategy.","Peter S. van Eck, Wander Jager, and Peter S.

Examples show that the allocation of functions within a city contributes to the appearance of traffic congestion and therefore emissions.

Using the example of the US power grid as a complex adaptive system, we demonstrate how components in a multi-layered power grid structure dynamically interact, evolve and adapt over time. In our model, electricity regulators strive to balance workload by dynamically adjusting service attributes in response to demand uctuations. Additionally, they seek to change long-term consumption patterns by providing incentives and social education. Moreover, consumer agents focus on maximizing quantitative and qualitative utilities. By embedding a non-convex optimization model with the agent-based framework we study cooperativeness or competition in the consumers game environment. Our framework allows us to study the behavior of consumers under di_erent control and incentive strategies. We expand model dynamics to include intrinsic environment and control factors. This study also examines circumstances in which agent-based and equilibrium models present similar outcomes or are unable to converge to same results. This method is used to study the robustness of the results, present equilibriums of interoperability equations, and study dynamics of traits.","Moeed Haghnevis, Amit Shinde, Ronald G.

10/28/2011 18:27:55,Article,Agent-based model simulations of future changes in migration flows for Burkina Faso,"Attempts to quantify the numbers of migrants generated by changes in climate have commonly been calculated by projecting physical climate changes on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change.","Dominic Kniveton, Christopher Smith and Sharon Wood",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.09.006,Sascha,"Social Conflict, Social Networks, Societal Transition, ABM methodical, Spatial and Ecological-Economic",,232,Global Environmental Change
10/28/2011 18:50:26,Article,A Time-Varying Propagation Model of Hot Topic on BBS Sites and Blog Networks,"Modeling the propagation of hot online topic is a preliminary requirement of predicting the trend of hot online topic. We propose a time-varying hot topic propagation model in online discussion context based upon the collective behavior of users who are in different social subgroups on blog networks and bulletin board system (BBS) sites. By analyzing the stability of the equilibrium of our model, we search for the threshold to be watershed of the trend of hot online topic and generalize about two theorems from the results of analysis, they exposit two sufficient conditions under which the trend of hot online topic will die out or remain uniformly weakly persistent. Furthermore, we propose methods to predict the trend of hot online topic on the strength of our model and theorems. For different motivation, we design two methods: Method (I) is mainly served as a way of theoretical research for predicting long trend of single-peak hot online topic by the thresholds of theorems; and for application, we design method (II) to predict the number of users writing or commenting upon article posts with respect to multi-peak hot online topic and single-peak one in the following two days with the help of Method (I). Experiments of two methods are performed on widely-discussed topics on the Sina Blog and the famous Liang Quan Qi Mei (LQQM) BBS and Xi’an Jiaotong University (BMY) BBS in China. The experimental results show that our methods predict the trend of hot online topic efficiently not only for theoretical motivation but also for applicable motivation, and reduce the computational complexity. Hence, our model can serve as basis for predicting trends in hot online topic propagation.","Zhang Beibeia, Xiaohong Guana, Muhammad Junaid Khanc, Yadong Zhou",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2011.09.025,Sascha,"Social Networks, Societal Transition",,232,Information Sciences
10/28/2011 18:53:44,Article,A functional framework for agent-based models of exchange,"We propose a functional framework for studying agent-based dynamical models of exchange. The framework consists of a notation and of a number of elementary definitions. We argue that – in comparison to narrative descriptions – the framework has a number of advantages: (1) it allows one to express precisely the relationships between the classical notion of general equilibrium and agent-based models of exchange; (2) it supports computational descriptions of models of exchange which can be unambiguously implemented; (3) it assists the numerical investigation of such models by providing a specific set of elementary notions and computational primitives. These can be used to deduce model properties and to setup “crucial” numerical experiments for validating model implementations. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to specify and study a model of exchange in which multiple equilibrium prices coexist and prices evolve according to a simple trading scheme and to a generic genetic rule.

11/11/2011 11:25:42,Book,Computational Aspects of Cooperative Game Theory,"Cooperative game theory is a branch of (micro-)economics that studies the behavior of self-interested agents in strategic settings where binding agreements among agents are possible. Our aim in this book is to present a survey of work on the computational aspects of cooperative game theory. We begin by formally defining transferable utility games in characteristic function form, and introducing key solution concepts such as the core and the Shapley value. We then discuss two major issues that arise when considering such games from a computational perspective: identifying compact representations for games, and the closely related problem of efficiently computing solution concepts for games. We survey several formalisms for cooperative games that have been proposed in the literature, including, for example, cooperative games defined on networks, as well
as general compact representation schemes such as MC-nets and skill games. As a detailed case study, we consider weighted voting games: a widely-used and practically important class of cooperative games that inherently have a natural compact representation. We investigate the complexity of solution concepts for such games, and generalizations of them. We briefly discuss games with non-transferable utility and partition function games. We then overview algorithms for identifying welfare-maximizing coalition structures and methods used by rational agents to form coalitions (even under uncertainty), including
bargaining algorithms. We conclude by considering some developing topics, applications, and future research directions.","Georgios Chalkiadakis, Edith Elkind, and Michael Wooldridge

11/11/2011 13:18:20,Article,Progress in coupling models of human and coastal landscape change,"Humans are increasingly altering the Earth’s surface, and affecting processes that shape and reshape landscapes. In many cases, humans are reacting to landscape-change processes that represent natural hazards. Thus, the landscape is reacting to humans who are reacting to the landscape. When the timescales for landscape change are comparable to those of human dynamics, human and ‘natural’ components of developed environments are dynamically coupled—necessitating coupling models of human and physical/biological processes to study either environmental change or human responses. Here we focus on a case study coupling models of coastal economics and physical coastline change. In this modeling, coastline change results from patterns of wave-driven sediment transport and sea-level rise, and shoreline stabilization decisions are based on the benefits of wide beaches (capitalized into property values) balanced against the costs of stabilization. This interdisciplinary modeling highlights points that may apply to other coupled human/natural systems. First, climate change, by accelerating the rates of landscape change, tends to strengthen the coupling with human dynamics.[...] Second, socio-economic change can also strengthen the human/landscape coupling. [...] Our coupled modeling experiments show that spatial distributions of property values and erosion rates can jointly affect economic outcomes, resource allocation between communities, and patterns of shoreline change. These findings raise questions about coastal management strategies, and efficient and equitable allocation of scarce resources among coastal communities.","A.

The mechanisms leading to community formation are strongly related with social pressure and the topology of the contact network. Here, we discuss an approach to model social behavior which accounts for the protection by alike peers proportional to their relative abundance in the closest neighborhood. We explore the ensuing non-linear dynamics emphasizing the role of the specific structure of the social network, modeled by scale-free graphs. We find that both coexistence of opinions and consensus on the default position are possible stationary states of the model. In particular, we show how these states critically depend on the heterogeneity of the social network and the specific distribution of external control elements.",M. Balbás Gambra und E.

11/24/2011 18:21:28,Article,"Behaviour and space in agent-based modelling: Poverty patterns in East Kalimantan, Indonesia","Applied models of policy interventions are increasingly expected to consider households’ responses to these interventions, which makes agent-based modelling popular in applied policy situations. Implementing an adequate level of agent heterogeneity and mapping it into a spatial environment are critical factors of such applied modelling. However, policy applications demand the characterisation and parameterisation of behavioural response functions of heterogeneous agents and the spatial distribution of heterogeneous agents, which are neither highly transparent nor greatly tested steps in implementing agent-based models. This paper describes an agent-based model of fuel price changes for a case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and specifically: (a) the characterisation and parameterisation approach, (b) resulting agent types for approximating behavioural heterogeneity, and (c) emerging spatial poverty and deforestation patterns. The model highlights the spatial dynamics of poverty dynamics, indicating that the direct impact of deforestation on poverty among forest-dwelling communities is to trigger their migration into peri-urban areas. Overall, the model suggests that poverty increases in response to fuel price reductions.","A. Smajgl, E.

The investigation of complex contagions can provide crucial insights into social influence and behavior-adoption cascades on networks. In this paper, we introduce a model of a multi-stage complex contagion on networks. Agents at different stages --- which could, for example, represent differing levels of support for a social movement or differing levels of commitment to a certain product or idea --- exert different amounts of influence on their neighbors. We demonstrate that the presence of even one additional stage introduces novel dynamical behavior, including interplay between multiple cascades, that cannot occur in single-stage contagion models. We find, for example, that cascades --- and hence collective action --- can be driven not only by higher-stage influencers but also by lower-stage influencers. ","Sergey Melnik, Jonathan A.

However, since it is formulated within psychology, it has relatively little impact on the discussion of emotion modeling within computer science. This paper introduces a computational model for emotion generation and function by formalizing part of Döner’s PSI theory. We also borrowed some technical ideas from MicroPSI, one of the concrete implementations of PSI theory by Joscha Bach. Based on this computational model, a number of simulation experiments have been performed and evaluated. The experimental results show that the emotions of agents controlled by our proposed model can emerge from the interaction between the agents and the environment. Then the dynamics of this computational model are studied using Lewis’s dynamic theory of emotions. We successfully found hints of phase transitions in the emotional changes, including trigger, self-amplification and self-stabilization phases, as suggested by Lewis. Based on these simulation results, we argue that this computational model is a quite promising approach of modeling both emotion emergence and dynamics","Zhenhua Cai, Ben Goertzel, Changle Zhou, Yongfeng Zhang, Min Jiang, Gino Yu",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.11.002,Sascha,"Social Conflict, Complex Systems",,234,Cognitive Systems Research

CA model’s ability to simulate urban patterns and processes of urban expansion in a realistic way has been widely investigated, but the influence of macro-scale factors and processes has often been neglected. A CA-based model is proposed linking macro-scale processes to micro-dynamics in order to simulate the urban sprawl process. The model allocates new urban land in a disaggregated field of land units (cells) taking into account a) a wide range of demographic, accessibility, socioeconomic, environmental and urban planning data b) a set of local characteristics of cells and neighborhood interactions. The application of the model to real-world data is based on a multiple regression model quantifying the influence of macro-scale factors and on an automatic calibration process based on historical data where local coefficient scores for different areas are determined. An application in the urban agglomeration of Thessaloniki in Greece is presented, where the model is calibrated for the period 1990–2010 and is used to explore urban expansion until 2030.

Some types of noise can destroy an all-cooperator state. If, on the other hand, hubs are stable, then so is the all-C state.

Hereby, the designer defines the environmental model and the agent interfaces. A reward function captures a description of the overall agent performance with respect to the intended outcome of the agent behavior. Based on this setup, reinforcement learning techniques can be used for learning rules that are optimally governing the agent behavior. However, for really being useful for analysis, the human developer must be able to review and fully understand the learnt behavior program.

We integrate the consumer response model into the Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System (EMCAS). EMCAS is an agent-based model that simulates restructured electricity markets. We explore the impacts of dynamic-pricing on price spikes, peak demand, consumer energy bills, power supplier profits, and congestion costs.

We use this model to simulate the transmission of HCV on an empirical social network of PWID. A feature of our model is that sources of infection can be both network neighbours and non-neighbours via “importing”. Data-driven estimates of sharing frequency and rate of importing are provided. Compared to an appropriately calibrated fully connected network, the empirical network provides some protective effect on the time to primary infection. We also illustrate heterogeneities in incidence rate of infection, both across and within node degrees (i.e., number of network partners). We explore the reduced risk of infection from spontaneously clearing cutpoint nodes whose infection status oscillates, both in theory and in simulation. Further, we show our model-based estimate of per-event transmission probability largely agrees with previous estimates at the lower end of the range 1–3% commonly cited.","D.A. Rolls, G.

The paper draws on a combination of lessons from literature and the case of a companion modelling process conducted in the context of a conflict about land and forest management in Northern Thailand. Using insights from negotiation theories, we analyze specifically the influence of spatial representations on the way people interacted, discussed and learnt from each other in the participatory modelling process. We argue that models that are spatially too explicit and realistic can actually impede the exploration of innovative and integrative scenarios in which ecological, social and economic objectives are mutually enriching. Indeed, spatial representations might lead to think in terms of boundaries and segregated space, and therefore prevent from thinking in terms of multifunctional space and from finding innovative and integrative solutions.","Cécile Barnaud, Christophe Le Page, Pongchai Dumrongrojwatthana, Guy Trébuil",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.11.016,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General",,237,Environmental Modelling & Software

This study explores a range of plausible development trajectories for the system in terms of carbon emissions, fuel mix and prices with the currently employed policies and market setup. An agent-based simulation model is used in order to explore the dynamics of the system under eight different scenarios. The simulation experiments indicate the continuation of fossil fuel dominance as the energy source, and a shift from natural gas to coal seems likely in the base case. Even with CCS investments, such a development is demonstrated to cause a significant increase in carbon emissions beyond 2030, following two decades of almost-constant emission levels. In general, experiments indicate a very strong internal inertia in the system that is hard to overcome just by policies focusing on a single aspect of the system (e.g. demand, supply, or technology). It is also observed that significant reductions in carbon emissions can be attained as a joint outcome of increased green electricity demand, especially among large-scale end-users, and high carbon costs.","Gönenç Yücel, Cornelia van Daalen",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.024,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Market Dynamics, Agent-Based Modelling",,237,Energy Policy

Here we assess the interaction between slow and fast processes and how interpretations of adaptive capacity and system resilience are affected by the scale at which observations are made. Agent-based modeling is used to identify the social and demographic interactions between landscape and weather variability for pastoralists in Inner Asia at a variety of social scales and from temporal scales of societal change ranging from a few days to 1000 years. Results indicate that the scale of abrupt changes may not be proportional to the severity or duration of the weather event, but is highly impacted by internal social factors. At the scale of individual families, highly interconnected social systems with less mobility and restricted decision making are less effective. When viewed from the vantage point of larger social units, highly interconnected kinship systems and restrictions in access to land may serve purposes that are counterproductive for individual families.","J.

This paper presents a model taking account of the finite number of bike locations at the stations. In case of symmetry, as the system gets large, the mean field limit provides an insight of the system behavior. Convergence of the invariant measures is proved and closed form results are obtained. The influence of the parameters and of various load balancing strategies on the performance, measured by the proportion of so called problematic stations, is discussed. Even in this symmetry case, the system exhibits a poor performance. We show that simple incentives, such as suggesting users to return to the least loaded station among two, improve dramatically the situation. An asymmetric scenario is also investigated. In that case, simple incentives are not enough and regulation mechanisms, such as redistribution of the bikes by trucks, are needed.

Both complexity and emergence threaten to upset adherence to predefined categories, which supposedly allows for efficiency.  Indeed, traditional management thinking focuses on a retrospective coherence where ideas and events are assigned to categories, the categories are labeled, and outliers are treated as statistical deviants.  The study of how such attributed (retrospective) sense-making breaks down in and around organizations is the focus of social complexity theory. Coherence in the Midst of Complexity discusses the social complexity approach, where dialogue and stories allow for the degrees of freedom needed for the opportunities of emergence to take root.   The book focuses on the experience of coherence and how such experiential lessons differ from the establishment and maintenance of categories and labels.   The authors offer a four-fold logic for discussing experiential coherence and the embrace of emergence in organizations of all sizes.

One of the most obvious areas of concern is land use and land cover change. As a result, projects such as Urbanization and Global Environmental Change (UGEC) launched by the International Human Dimension Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP) and the Global Land Project (GLP) jointly proposed by IHDP and IGBP were developed to study the interactions between human activities, land systems, and natural environmental change. Based on a biophysical approach, urban energy theory and Multi-Objective Land Allocation (MOLA), the research presented here develops an integrated ecosystem model for the Taipei-Taoyuan area of Taiwan to enhance understanding of the interactions among energy flows, land use preferences and land use change. This paper illustrates how the joint application of an integrated ecosystem model with MOLA can be used in the simulation of land cover change in a region moving from an agricultural landscape to an urbanized system. The integrated ecosystem model also mimics the interactions between human preferences on land use and development allocations in socio-economic systems and potential material and energy flows in ecosystems with high spatial resolution.","Szu-Hua Wang, Shu-Li Huang, William W.

2/2/2012 11:14:06,Article,Evolutionary dynamics in finite populations can explain the full range of cooperative behaviors observed in the centipede game,"Classical economic models make behavioral predictions based on the assumption that people are fully rational and care only about maximizing their own payoffs. Although this approach successfully explains human behavior in many situations, there is a wealth of experimental evidence demonstrating conditions where people deviate from the predictions of these models. One setting that has received particular attention is offered by fixed length repeated games. Iterating a social dilemma can promote cooperation through direct reciprocity, even if it is common knowledge that all players are rational and self-interested. However, this is not the case if the length of the game is known to the players. In the final round, a rational player will defect, because there is no future to be concerned with. But if you know the other player will defect in the last round, then you should defect in the second to last round, and so on. This logic of backwards induction leads to immediate defection as the only rational (sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium) strategy. When people actually play such games, however, immediate defection is rare. Here we use evolutionary dynamics in finite populations to study the centipede game, which is designed to explore this issue of backwards induction. We make the following observation: since full cooperation can risk-dominate immediate defection in the centipede game, stochastic evolutionary dynamics can favor both delayed defection and even full cooperation. Furthermore, our evolutionary model can quantitatively reproduce human behavior from two experiments by fitting a single free parameter, which is the product of population size and selection intensity. Thus we provide evidence that people’s cooperative behavior in fixed length games, which is often called ‘irrational’, may in fact be the favored outcome of natural selection.","David G.

2/2/2012 20:28:31,Article,Towards a theoretical framework for analyzing integrated socio-environmental systems,"This article addresses two major challenges for an integrated analysis of socio-environmental systems, namely the diversity of contributing disciplines and the wide spectrum of temporal and spatial scales. Archaeology, the geosciences and socio-cultural anthropology provide information relating to a diversity of specific time series and spatial distribution maps in order to answer questions relating to the impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors in population growth and migration processes. A model based on the key idea of adaptive cycles as it was initially developed in resilience research can be productively employed to bridge the diversity of disciplines and to integrate the diversity of data that they provide. This article outlines first steps towards recognizing similar patterns across a wide spectrum of empirical observations. It is exploratory in its attempt to trace these patterns across different layers of understanding the complexity of human-environment interaction. [...] an adaptive cycle model is outlined, with phases of growth, conservation, distortion and reorganization. The model helps to infer internal dynamics in the diverse environmental and social domains without reducing one domain to another while still connecting evidence from a host of different sources. More generally, such a model could help in understanding features of non-linearity, multifactoral relations, scale dependency and time-lags which seem to be typical for the complex dynamics of integrated socio-environmental systems.","Thomas Widlok, Anne Aufgebauer, Marcel Bradtmöller, Richard Dikau, Thomas Hoffmann, Inga Kretschmer, Konstantinos Panagiotopoulos, Andreas Pastoors, Robin Peters, Frank Schaebitz, Manuela Schlummer, Martin Solich, Bernd Wagner, Gerd-Christian Weniger and Andreas Zimmermann",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.01.020,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Societal Transitions, Complex Systems",,239,Quaternary International

Based on demand and supply considerations the evolutionary model presented here derives explicitly Gibrat’s law of proportionate effects as the result of the competition between products. Applying a preferential attachment mechanism for firms, the theory allows to establish the size distribution of products and firms. Also established are the growth rate and price distribution of consumer goods. Taking into account the characteristic property of human activities to occur in bursts, the model allows also an explanation of the size–variance relationship of the growth rate distribution of products and firms. Further the product life cycle, the learning (experience) curve and the market size in terms of the mean number of firms that can survive in a market are derived. The model also suggests the existence of an invariant of a market as the ratio of total profit to total revenue. The relationship between a neo-classic and an evolutionary view of a market is discussed. The comparison with empirical investigations suggests that the theory is able to describe the main stylized facts concerning the size and growth of firms.",Joachim Kaldasch,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2012.01.027,Sascha,Market Dynamics,,239,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications

Agents in our evolutionary model are arranged on a network and interact in a Prisoner's dilemma with their neighbors. They learn from their own experience and that of their neighbors in the network about the past behavior of others and use this information when making their choices. Each agent can only process information from her last h interactions. We show that if memory (h) is too short, cooperation does not emerge in the long run. A slight increase of memory length to around 5-10 periods, though, can lead to largely cooperative societies. Longer memory, on the other hand, is detrimental to cooperation in our model.","Gergely Horváth, Jaromír Kovárík, Friederike Mengel",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.01.034,Sascha,Game Theory,,239,Journal of Theoretical Biology

2/16/2012 21:03:09,Article,Conditional strategies and the evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods games,"The fact that individuals will most likely behave differently in different situations begets the introduction of conditional strategies. Inspired by this, we study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game, where besides unconditional cooperators and defectors, also different types of conditional cooperators compete for space. Conditional cooperators will contribute to the public good only if other players within the group are likely to cooperate as well, but will withhold their contribution otherwise. Depending on the number of other cooperators that are required to elicit cooperation of a conditional cooperator, the latter can be classified in as many types as there are players within each group. We find that the most cautious cooperators, such that require all other players within a group to be conditional cooperators, are the undisputed victors of the evolutionary process, even at very low synergy factors. We show that the remarkable promotion of cooperation is due primarily to the spontaneous emergence of quarantining of defectors, which become surrounded by conditional cooperators and are forced into isolated convex ""bubbles"" from where they are unable to exploit the public good. This phenomenon can be observed only in structured populations, thus adding to the relevance of pattern formation for the successful evolution of cooperation.

The archetypical signature of this phenomenon is that—beyond the increase in the level of fluctuations—the response of the system becomes uncorrelated with the external driving force, making it different from stochastic resonance. Numerical simulations and an analytical theory of a stochastic dynamical version of the Ising model on regular and random networks demonstrate the ubiquity and robustness of this phenomenon, which is argued to be a possible cause of excess volatility in financial markets, of enhanced effective temperatures in a variety of out-of-equilibrium systems, and of strong selective responses of immune systems of complex biological organisms.

Here, we show that certain individuals are disproportionately influential in self-organised decisions in a system where all individuals share the same interests: nest site selection by the ant Temnothorax albipennis. Workers that visited a good available nest site prior to emigration (the familiar nest) memorised its location, and later used this memory to navigate efficiently and find that nest faster than through random exploration. Additionally, these workers relied on their private information to expedite individual decisions about the familiar nest. This conferred a bias in favour of familiar nests over novel nests during emigrations. Informed workers were shown to have a significantly greater share in both recruitment and transport to the familiar nest than naïve workers. This suggests that they were the main determinants of the collective preference for familiar nests, and thus contributed greatly to enhance collective performance. Overall, these results indicate that self-organised decisions are not always evenly shared among decision-makers, even in systems where there are no conflicts of interest. Animal groups may instead benefit from well-informed, knowledgeable individuals acting as leaders in decisions. ","Nathalie Stroeymeyt, Nigel R.

In the same way, we rationalize also the behavior of the maximum memory used during the convergence process, which determines the minimum cognitive/storage capacity needed by the individuals.

Luhmann noted that this elusive order contains a trade-off between ""organization"" at interfaces integrating (differently coded) expectations at each moment of time, and the potential of further differentiation among symbolically generalized codes of communication in a ""self-organization"" over time. One can model the coding in the communication of meaning as eigenvectors which evolve as an implication of the interacting intentions and expectations. The interacting horizons of meaning generate new options (redundancy) against the arrow of time, since meaning is provided to events from the perspective of hindsight. Using the theory and computation of anticipatory systems, ""self-organization"" and ""interaction"" can be considered as hyper-incursive routines that use (expectations of) future states for their reconstruction, whereas ""organization"" operates in terms of instantiations (of expectations). Mathematical metaphors can guide us in further exploring the nonlinear dynamics of a social order of intentions and expectations without reification.",Loet Leydesdorff,http://eprints.rclis.org/bitstream/10760/16576/1/v13Feb12.pdf,Richard,"Methods in General, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,240,
2/28/2012 23:12:52,Article,Implementing comprehensive offender behaviour in a realistic agent-based model of burglary,"Explaining and modelling crime patterns is an exercise that has taxed policy-makers, criminologists, social reformers and the police ever since the first crime patterns were recorded. Crime is a particularly difficult phenomenon to model because of its inherent complexity; crime patterns are built up from a multitude of human-human and human-environment micro-interactions that ultimately lead to individual crime events. Commonly used modelling techniques, such as regression, struggle to fully account for the dynamics of the crime system. They work at aggregate scales thereby disregarding important individual-level variation and also struggle to account for the effects of different types of human behaviour. Furthermore, important concepts from environmental criminology – such as individual offender awareness spaces or heterogeneity in offender decision-making – cannot be included directly when working at a resolution above that of the individual.
This research addresses the drawbacks associated with traditional mathematical crime models by building an agent-based simulation with a unique offender behavioural model. Through use of the PECS framework for modelling human behaviour, agents are endowed with needs and motives that drive their behaviour and ultimately lead to the commission of crime. As the model uses real-world environmental data, it can be used to make predictions in existing cities.

3/1/2012 11:27:10,Book,Sociophysics: A Physicist's Modeling of Psycho-political Phenomena,"Do humans behave much like atoms? Sociophysics, which uses tools and concepts from the physics of disordered matter to describe some aspects of social and political behavior, answers in the affirmative. But advocating the use of models from the physical sciences to understand human behavior could be perceived as tantamount to dismissing the existence of human free will and also enabling those seeking manipulative skills . This thought-provoking book argues it is just the contrary. Indeed, future developments and evaluation will either show sociophysics to be inadequate, thus supporting the hypothesis that people can primarily be considered to be free agents, or valid, thus opening the path to a radically different vision of society and personal responsibility. This book attempts to explain why and how humans behave much like atoms, at least in some aspects of their collective lives, and then proposes how this knowledge can serve as a unique key to a dramatic leap forwards in achieving more social freedom in the real world. At heart, sociophysics and this book are about better comprehending the richness and potential of our social interaction, and so distancing ourselves from inanimate atoms.",Serge Galam,http://www.amazon.com/dp/1461420318/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=compldiges-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=1461420318&adid=1D5Y2DY37WT6S7XVKT52&,Sascha,"Methods in General, Game Theory, Complex Systems",,241,Springer
3/2/2012 12:34:27,Article,Disseminating a warning message to evacuate: A simulation study of the behaviour of neighbours,"Large-scale evacuations are a recurring theme on news channels, whether in response to major natural or manmade disasters. The role of warning dissemination is a key part in the success of such large-scale evacuations and its inadequacy in certain cases has been a ‘primary contribution to deaths and injuries’ (Hayden et al., 2007). Along with technology-driven ‘official warning channels’ (e.g. sirens, mass media), the role of unofficial channel (e.g. neighbours, personal contacts, volunteer wardens) has proven to be significant in warning the public of the need to evacuate. Although post-evacuation studies identify the behaviours of evacuees as disseminators of the warning message, there has not been a detailed study that quantifies the effects of such behaviour on the warning message dissemination. This paper develops an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) model of multiple agents (evacuee households) in a hypothetical community to investigate the impact of behaviour as an unofficial channel on the overall warning dissemination. Parameters studied include the percentage of people who warn their neighbours, the efficiency of different official warning channels, and delay time to warn neighbours. Even with a low proportion of people willing to warn their neighbour, the results showed considerable impact on the overall warning dissemination.

3/2/2012 12:36:06,Article,Self-organization in An Agent Network: A Mechanism and A Potential Application,"Self-organization provides a suitable paradigm for developing self-managed complex computing systems, e.g., decision support systems. Towards this end, in this paper, a composite self-organization mechanism in an agent network is proposed. To intuitively elucidate this mechanism, a task allocation environment is simulated. Based on self-organization principles, this mechanism enables agents to dynamically adapt relations with other agents, i.e., to change the underlying network structure, so as to achieve efficient task allocation. The proposed mechanism utilizes a trust model to assist agents in reasoning with whom to adapt relations and employs a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm for agents to learn how to adapt relations. Moreover, in this mechanism, it is considered that the agents are connected by weighted relations, instead of crisp relations. The proposed mechanism is evaluated through a comparison with a centralized mechanism and the K-Adapt mechanism in both closed and open agent networks. Experimental results demonstrate the adequate performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of the entire network profit and time consumption. Additionally, a potential application scenario of this mechanism is also given, which exhibits the potential applicability of this mechanism in some real world cases.","Dayong Ye, Minjie Zhang, Danny Sutanto",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2012.02.009,Sascha,"Agent-Based Modelling, Social Networks",,241,Decision Support Systems
3/15/2012 14:09:05,Article,Towards the integration of spread and economic impacts of biological invasions in a landscape of learning and imitating agents,"We develop an agent-based model integrated with a spatial stochastic simulation harmful non-indigenous species (NIS) spread model in which farmers have learning and imitation capabilities. The model is applied to the western corn rootworm (WCR) invasion in the UK. The invasion is never eradicated due to the high dispersal capacity of WCR, particularly under climate change conditions. The lowest expected welfare losses arise with a laissez faire policy against the invasion. The effectiveness of NIS control programmes that require participation by land managers is shown to depend greatly on their learning and imitation dynamics. Control programmes might fail completely if there is global knowledge of the burdens of compliance – e.g. through the media – and the land managers can foresee the future consequences of new actions. This is due to coordinated noncompliance occurring across the landscape. If the agents need to experience compliance to learn its consequences or communicate only locally, potential noncompliant behaviour spreads more slowly than the invasion front and trails behind it. In conclusion, negative opinions of land managers over NIS control programmes and their media coverage can strongly undermine programmes. Identification and management of these factors may increase the odds of success of the programmes.","L. Roman Carrasco, David Cook, Richard Baker, Alan MacLeod, Jon D. Knight, John D.

Modelling & simulation of crowd is a typical paradigm, especially when dealing with large crowd. On top of a hierarchical Grid simulation infrastructure, a simulation of evacuating tens of thousands of pedestrians in an urban area has been constructed. The simulation infrastructure can facilitate a large crowd simulation comprising models of different grains and various types in nature. A number of agent-based and computational models residing at two distinctive administrative domains operate together, which successfully presents the dynamics of the complex scenario at scales of both individual and crowd levels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid modelling & simulation approach can effectively cope with the size and complexity of a scenario involving a huge crowd.","Dan Chen, Lizhe Wang, Xiaomin Wu, Jingying Chen, Samee U.

This idea was proposed by Becker more than forty years ago Becker (1968) [1]. In this paper, we simulate a simple artificial society, in which agents earn fixed wages and can augment (or lose) wealth as a result of a successful (or not) act of crime. The probability of apprehension depends on the gravity of the crime, and the punishment takes the form of imprisonment and fines. We study the costs of the law enforcement system required for keeping crime within acceptable limits, and compare it with the harm produced by crime. A sharp phase transition is observed as a function of the probability of punishment, and this transition exhibits a clear hysteresis effect, suggesting that the cost of reversing a deteriorated situation might be much higher than that of maintaining a relatively low level of delinquency. Besides, we analyze economic consequences that arise from crimes under different scenarios of criminal activity and probabilities of apprehension.","J.R. Iglesias, V. Semeshenko, Eder M.

However, existing web-based modelling frameworks currently offer no support for managing uncertainty. On the other hand, the rich array of modelling frameworks and simulation tools which support uncertainty propagation in complex and chained models typically lack the benefits of web based solutions such as ready publication, discoverability and easy access. In this article we describe the developments within the UncertWeb project which are designed to provide uncertainty support in the context of the proposed ‘Model Web’. We give an overview of uncertainty in modelling, review uncertainty management in existing modelling frameworks and consider the semantic and interoperability issues raised by integrated modelling. We describe the scope and architecture required to support uncertainty management as developed in UncertWeb. This includes tools which support elicitation, aggregation/disaggregation, visualisation and uncertainty/sensitivity analysis. We conclude by highlighting areas that require further research and development in UncertWeb, such as model calibration and inference within complex environmental models.","Lucy Bastin, Dan Cornford, Richard Jones, Gerard B.M.

This goes against widespread simulation practices of evolutionary games, where players frequently consider changing their strategy even though their payoffs may be marginally different than those of the other players. Inspired by this observation, we introduce an aspiration-based win-stay-lose-learn strategy updating rule into the spatial prisoner's dilemma game. The rule is simple and intuitive, foreseeing strategy changes only by dissatisfied players, who then attempt to adopt the strategy of one of their nearest neighbors, while the strategies of satisfied players are not subject to change. We find that the proposed win-stay-lose-learn rule promotes the evolution of cooperation, and it does so very robustly and independently of the initial conditions. In fact, we show that even a minute initial fraction of cooperators may be sufficient to eventually secure a highly cooperative final state. In addition to extensive simulation results that support our conclusions, we also present results obtained by means of the pair approximation of the studied game. Our findings continue the success story of related win-stay strategy updating rules, and by doing so reveal new ways of resolving the prisoner's dilemma.","Yongkui Liu, Xiaojie Chen, Lin Zhang, Long Wang, Matjaz Perc",doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030689,Sascha,Game Theory,,243,PLoS ONE

We extend the traditional approach by assuming that a population contains individuals with different learning abilities. In particular, we explore the situation where individuals have different search spaces, when attempting to learn the strategies of others. The search space of an individual specifies the set of strategies learnable by that individual. The search space is genetically given and does not change under social evolutionary dynamics. We introduce a general framework and study a specific example in the context of direct reciprocity. For this example, we obtain the counter intuitive result that cooperation can only evolve for intermediate benefit-to-cost ratios, while small and large benefit-to-cost ratios favor defection. Our paper is a step toward making a connection between computational learning theory and evolutionary game dynamics.","Krishnendu Chatterjee, Damien Zufferey, Martin A.

We replicate the Rogers' paradox in the cumulative setting.

Here we show that realistic fashion-like dynamics emerge spontaneously if individuals can copy others' preferences for cultural traits as well as traits themselves. We demonstrate this dynamics in simple mathematical models of the diffusion, and subsequent abandonment, of a single cultural trait which individuals may or may not prefer. We then simulate the coevolution between many cultural traits and the associated preferences, reproducing power-law frequency distributions of cultural traits (most traits are adopted by few individuals for a short time, and very few by many for a long time), as well as correlations between the rate of increase and the rate of decrease of traits (traits that increase rapidly in popularity are also abandoned quickly and vice versa). We also establish that alternative theories, that fashions result from individuals signaling their social status, or from individuals randomly copying each other, do not satisfactorily reproduce these empirical observations.","Alberto Acerbi, Stefano Ghirlanda, Magnus Enquist",doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0032541,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Complex Systems",,243,PLoS ONE
3/30/2012 10:10:26,Article,"Learning, Social Intelligence and the Turing Test - why an ""out-of-the-box"" Turing Machine will not pass the Turing Test","The Turing Test (TT) checks for human intelligence, rather than any putative general intelligence. It involves repeated interaction requiring learning in the form of adaption to the human conversation partner. It is a macro-level post-hoc test in contrast to the definition of a Turing Machine (TM), which is a prior micro-level definition. This raises the question of whether learning is just another computational process, i.e. can be implemented as a TM. Here we argue that learning or adaption is fundamentally different from computation, though it does involve processes that can be seen as computations. To illustrate this difference we compare (a) designing a TM and (b) learning a TM, defining them for the purpose of the argument. We show that there is a well-defined sequence of problems which are not effectively designable but are learnable, in the form of the bounded halting problem. Some characteristics of human intelligence are reviewed including it's: interactive nature, learning abilities, imitative tendencies, linguistic ability and context-dependency. A story that explains some of these is the Social Intelligence Hypothesis. If this is broadly correct, this points to the necessity of a considerable period of acculturation (social learning in context) if an artificial intelligence is to pass the TT. Whilst it is always possible to 'compile' the results of learning into a TM, this would not be a designed TM and would not be able to continually adapt (pass future TTs). We conclude three things, namely that: a purely ""designed"" TM will never pass the TT; that there is no such thing as a general intelligence since it necessary involves learning; and that learning/adaption and computation should be clearly distinguished.

Up to now, linking the global networked dynamics to such individual mechanisms has remained elusive. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in networked populations and let individuals interact via a 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma – a characteristic defection dominant social dilemma of cooperation. We show how homogeneous networks transform a Prisoner's Dilemma into a population-wide evolutionary dynamics that promotes the coexistence between cooperators and defectors, while heterogeneous networks promote their coordination. To this end, we define a dynamic variable that allows us to track the self-organization of cooperators when co-evolving with defectors in networked populations. Using the same variable, we show how the global dynamics — and effective dilemma — co-evolves with the motifs of cooperators in the population, the overall emergence of cooperation depending sensitively on this co-evolution.","Flávio L.

For some phenomena the answer may seem too obvious to warrant even asking the question, but other phenomena cover the gamut, from high to low levels of abstraction. This paper explores how two modelling approaches that are ‘at home’ at opposite ends of the abstraction spectrum can be combined to yield an evolutionary modelling approach that is especially apt for phenomena that cover a wide range in this spectrum.
We employ fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to model the interplay between high-level concepts, and cellular automata (CA) to model the low-level interactions between individual actors. The combination of these models carries both beyond their respective limitations: the FCM concept is extended beyond the derivation of equilibrium outcomes from static initial conditions, to time-evolving systems where conditions may vary; CA are extended beyond the emergence of patterns from local interactions, to systems where global patterns have local repercussions.
The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by modelling the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in an environment in which injection drug users share paraphernalia.","Vijay K.

However, new challenges have arisen since urban shrinkage entered the research agenda of the social and land-use sciences. Therefore, the focus of this paper is a twofold one: Using the example of urban shrinkage, we first discuss the capacity of existing land-use modeling approaches to integrate new social science knowledge in terms of land-use, demography and governance because social science models are indispensable for accurately explaining the processes behind shrinkage. Second, we discuss the combination of system dynamics (SD), cellular automata (CA) and agent-based model (ABM) approaches to cover the main characteristics, processes and patterns of urban shrinkage. Using Leipzig, Germany, as a case study, we provide the initial results of a joint SD-CA model and an ABM that both operationalize social science knowledge regarding urban shrinkage.","Dagmar Haase, Annegret Haase, Nadja Kabisch, Sigrun Kabisch, Dieter Rink",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.02.012,Sascha,Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues,,243,Environmental Modelling & Software
3/30/2012 10:46:07,Article,Bars on blocks: A cellular automata model of crime and liquor licensed establishment density,"Criminologists have extensively researched the problems generated by licensed establishments. Violent offending and disorderly behavior resulting from pubs, taverns, dance clubs and bars are of particular interest to this field of study. The relative density of these liquor establishments has been found to be associated with the level of violence and disorder in surrounding areas. A complex systems approach can be used to further understand the dynamic interplay between licensed establishments, violent offending and disorder, and urban planning decisions. The model presented here utilizes cellular automata as the mathematical framework to view the varying impact of liquor licensing density on crime. This study uses a sample of liquor establishments and crime data from the City of Vancouver in British Columbia. The cellular automata model incorporates transition rules which govern the change of city blocks from low-risk blocks to high-risk blocks. The results represented by a 50 × 50 cellular grid show that high-risk blocks multiply when liquor licenses are grouped. Two scenarios are presented to contrast the impact of grouping high-risk blocks which contain more liquor establishments and dispersing such blocks. A third scenario demonstrates how increasing the positive influence in a grouped scenario stops high-risk blocks from taking over the entire grid. Future iterations of this model will incorporate census data, public transportation data, land use data and entertainment districts from other cities to further analyze the effect of licensed establishments on the distribution of crime.","Valerie Spicer, Andrew A.

However, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future.

As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units.

Although this line of thinking may help facilitate decision making processes, it is only as defensible as the degree at which the system under consideration behaves linearly. Recent work shows that diverse properties of cities exhibit power-law relationships with population size. Such relationships may invalidate the reliance on linear thinking. Furthermore, in the era of globalization, resources and people move virtually freely through bounds of any confines used to define a system. We incorporate into a simple resource-population model the power-law scaling behavior and the influence of import and immigration, and investigate their effects on sustainable growth of communities. We explore through bifurcation analysis the different scenarios of how an unsustainable system could be sustained. Import can be effective if: the import exceeds a critical level and a critical mass of people populates the system. In contrast, increasing immigration alone can rescue the intrinsically unsustainable system, both directly through people entering the system and indirectly by increasing its harvesting ability, although critical values exist that cause the population to sharply rise or shrink.","Rachata Muneepeerakul, Murad R.

3/30/2012 14:11:52,Article,Stochastic evolutionary dynamics resolve the Traveler's Dilemma,"Behavior in social dilemmas is often inconsistent with the predictions of classical game theory: people (and a wide variety of other organisms) are more cooperative than might be expected. Here we consider behavior in one such social dilemma, the Traveler's Dilemma, that has received considerable attention in the economics literature but is little known among theoretical biologists. The rules of the game are as follows. Two players each choose a value between R and M, where 0<R<M. If the players choose the same value, both receive that amount. If the players choose different values v1 and v2, where v1<v2, then the player choosing v1 earns v1+R and the player choosing v2 earns v1−R. While the players would maximize their payoffs by both declaring the largest possible value, M, the Nash equilibrium is to declare the smallest possible value, R. In behavioral experiments, however, people generally declare values much larger than the minimum and the deviation from the expected equilibrium decreases with R. In this paper, we show that the cooperative behavior observed in the Traveler's Dilemma can be explained in an evolutionary framework. We study stochastic evolutionary dynamics in finite populations with varying intensity of selection and varying mutation rate. We derive analytic results showing that strategies declaring high values can be favored when selection is weak. More generally, selection favors strategies that declare high values if R is small (relative to M) and strategies that declare low values if R is large. Finally, we show that a two-parameter model involving the intensity of selection and the mutation rate can quantitatively reproduce data that from a Traveler's Dilemma experiment. These results demonstrate the power of evolutionary game theory for explaining human behavior in contexts that are challenging for standard economic game theory.","Michael L. Manapat, David G.

It advances several different specifications of the endogenous switching between the trading strategies and then estimates these models by the method of simulated moments (MSM), where the choice of the moments reflects the basic stylized facts of the daily returns of a stock market index. In addition to the standard version of MSM with a quadratic loss function, we also take into account how often a great number of Monte Carlo simulation runs happen to yield moments that are all contained within their empirical confidence intervals. The model contest along these lines reveals a strong role for a (tamed) herding component. The quantitative performance of the winner model is so good that it may provide a standard for future research.","Reiner Franke, Frank Westerhoff",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2011.10.004,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Agent-Based Modelling",,243,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control

Drawing on ideas from global games and network growth, we show how network topology interacts with the funding structure of financial institutions to determine system-wide crises. Bad news about a financial institution can lead others to lose confidence in it and their withdrawals, in turn, trigger problems across the interbank network. Once broken, credit relations take a long time to re-establish as a result of common knowledge of the equilibrium.

4/12/2012 18:48:13,Article,Competition among memes in a world with limited attention,"The wide adoption of social media has increased the competition among ideas for our finite attention. We employ a parsimonious agent-based model to study whether such a competition may affect the popularity of different memes, the diversity of information we are exposed to, and the fading of our collective interests for specific topics. Agents share messages on a social network but can only pay attention to a portion of the information they receive. In the emerging dynamics of information diffusion, a few memes go viral while most do not. The predictions of our model are consistent with empirical data from Twitter, a popular microblogging platform. Surprisingly, we can explain the massive heterogeneity in the popularity and persistence of memes as deriving from a combination of the competition for our limited attention and the structure of the social network, without the need to assume different intrinsic values among ideas.","L.

We explore this dependence using community networks with different levels of structural heterogeneity, which are generated by a tunable upper-bound on the total number of links that any vertex can have. We study the effect of community structure on cooperation by analyzing a finite population analogue of the evolutionary replicator dynamics. We find that structural heterogeneity mediates the effect of community structure on cooperation. In the community networks with low level of structural heterogeneity, community structure has negative effect on cooperation. However, the positive effect of community structure on cooperation appears and enhances with increasing structural heterogeneity. Our work may be helpful for understanding the complexity of cooperative behaviors in social networks.","Fengjie Xie, Wentian Cui, Jun Lin",DOI: 10.1002/cplx.20397,Sascha,"Game Theory, Complex Systems, Social Networks",,244,Complexity
4/12/2012 19:03:00,Article,Activity driven modeling of dynamic networks,"Network modeling plays a critical role in identifying statistical regularities and structural principles common to many systems. The large majority of recent modeling approaches are connectivity driven, in the sense that the structural pattern of the network is at the basis of the mechanisms ruling the network formation. Connectivity driven models necessarily provide a time-aggregated representation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating dynamics of many networks. We address this challenge by defining the activity potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions in real-world networks and constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous time description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of structural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from the heterogeneous activity of agents. Additionally, we find that diffusive processes in highly dynamical networks can be described analytically in terms of the activity potential, allowing a quantitative discussion of the biases induced by the time-aggregated network representation in the analysis of dynamical processes in evolving networks.

Despite growing interest in its use, little guidance exists for modellers regarding the nature and variety of hybrid simulation models.

Based on an up-to-date review of the literature, we propose three basic types of hybrid agent-based system dynamics simulations, referred to here as interfaced, integrated and sequential hybrid designs. We speculate that the classification presented may also be useful for other classes of hybrid simulations.","Chris Swinerd, Ken R.

4/12/2012 19:34:29,Article,"Movement patterns, social dynamics, and the evolution of cooperation","The structure of social interactions influences many aspects of social life, including the spread of information and behavior, and the evolution of social phenotypes. After dispersal, organisms move around throughout their lives, and the patterns of their movement influence their social encounters over the course of their lifespan. Though both space and mobility are known to influence social evolution, there is little analysis of the influence of specific movement patterns on evolutionary dynamics. We explored the effects of random movement strategies on the evolution of cooperation using an agent-based prisoner’s dilemma model with mobile agents. This is the first systematic analysis of a model in which cooperators and defectors can use different random movement strategies, which we chose to fall on a spectrum between highly exploratory and highly restricted in their search tendencies. Because limited dispersal and restrictions to local neighborhood size are known to influence the ability of cooperators to effectively assort, we also assessed the robustness of our findings with respect to dispersal and local capacity constraints. We show that differences in patterns of movement can dramatically influence the likelihood of cooperator success, and that the effects of different movement patterns are sensitive to environmental assumptions about offspring dispersal and local space constraints. Since local interactions implicitly generate dynamic social interaction networks, we also measured the average number of unique and total interactions over a lifetime and considered how these emergent network dynamics helped explain the results. This work extends what is known about mobility and the evolution of cooperation, and also has general implications for social models with randomly moving agents.","Paul E. Smaldino, Jeffrey C.

Demography and cultural evolution: how adaptive cultural processes can produce maladaptive losses the Tasmanian case. Am. Antiquity 69, 197–214] proposed a model designed to show that larger population size facilitates cumulative cultural evolution toward higher skill levels. In this model, each newborn attempts to imitate the most highly skilled individual of the parental generation by directly-biased social learning, but the skill level he/she acquires deviates probabilistically from that of the exemplar (cultural parent). The probability that the skill level of the imitator exceeds that of the exemplar can be regarded as the innovation rate. After reformulating Henrich’s model rigorously, we introduce an overlapping-generations analog based on the Moran model and derive an approximate formula for the expected change per generation of the highest skill level in the population. For large population size, our overlapping-generations model predicts a much larger effect of population size than Henrich’s discrete-generations model. We then investigate by way of Monte Carlo simulations the case where each newborn chooses as his/her exemplar the most highly skilled individual from among a limited number of acquaintances. When the number of acquaintances is small relative to the population size, we find that a change in the innovation rate contributes more than a proportional change in population size to the cumulative cultural evolution of skill level.","Yutaka Kobayashi, Kenichi Aoki",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2012.04.001,Sascha,Societal Transitions,,245,Theoretical Population Biology

5/11/2012 14:33:26,Article,Different Reactions to Adverse Neighborhoods in Games of Cooperation,"In social dilemmas, cooperation among randomly interacting individuals is often difficult to achieve. The situation changes if interactions take place in a network where the network structure jointly evolves with the behavioral strategies of the interacting individuals. In particular, cooperation can be stabilized if individuals tend to cut interaction links when facing adverse neighborhoods. Here we consider two different types of reaction to adverse neighborhoods, and all possible mixtures between these reactions. When faced with a gloomy outlook, players can either choose to cut and rewire some of their links to other individuals, or they can migrate to another location and establish new links in the new local neighborhood. We find that in general local rewiring is more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than emigration from adverse neighborhoods. Rewiring helps to maintain the diversity in the degree distribution of players and favors the spontaneous emergence of cooperative clusters. Both properties are known to favor the evolution of cooperation on networks. Interestingly, a mixture of migration and rewiring is even more favorable for the evolution of cooperation than rewiring on its own. While most models only consider a single type of reaction to adverse neighborhoods, the coexistence of several such reactions may actually be an optimal setting for the evolution of cooperation.","Zhang, C.; Zhang, J.; Weissing, F.

In reality, there is heterogeneity in the number of contacts per individual, and individuals tend to imitate others who appear to have adopted successful strategies. Here, we use network-based mathematical models to study the effects of both imitation behavior and contact heterogeneity on vaccination coverage and disease dynamics. We integrate contact network epidemiological models with a framework for decision-making, within which individuals make their decisions either based purely on payoff maximization or by imitating the vaccination behavior of a social contact. Simulations suggest that when the cost of vaccination is high imitation behavior may decrease vaccination coverage. However, when the cost of vaccination is small relative to that of infection, imitation behavior increases vaccination coverage, but, surprisingly, also increases the magnitude of epidemics through the clustering of non-vaccinators within the network. Thus, imitation behavior may impede the eradication of infectious diseases. Calculations that ignore behavioral clustering caused by imitation may significantly underestimate the levels of vaccination coverage required to attain herd immunity.","Ndeffo Mbah, M.

Consumer decisions to purchase these technologies are also influenced by several complex criteria such as costs/benefits, performance, appeal/status, risk, psychographics, and demographics. This complexity motivated the development of an innovative diffusion model, incorporating features of multi criteria analysis and choice modelling, to estimate the adoption of these technology options spatially across the landscape of heterogeneous consumers. We test the model to forecast market share of EVs through to 2030, using the vehicle stock across all 1.5 million households in Victoria, Australia. Seven financial and non-financial criteria were included and calibrated via focus groups and a large scale survey. Annual change of criteria values and their elasticity to adoption were incorporated. Geographical differences in uptake of EVs were primarily due to driving distance, employment status and household income, with urban areas having about three times the proportional uptake. By testing the model for a range of incentives, we demonstrate its capability to inform and evaluate policy options.","Andrew Higgins, Phillip Paevere, John Gardner, George Quezada",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2012.04.008,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Market Dynamics",,247,Technological Forecasting and Social Change

(2) The presence of a social hierarchy can be an adaptive feature of the community: the steeper the optimal social hierarchy is, the fewer relationships group members need to have. (3) Falling communication costs lead to a less steep optimal social hierarchy in communities in which socially useful information is evenly distributed, but to an even steeper social hierarchy in groups in which socially useful information is uneven. Thus we show how, when communication is costly, cooperation can give rise to communities that are socially highly structured.","Tamas David-Barrett, R.I.M.

Two different wind penetration levels (12% and 24%) are investigated and compared. Based on MATPOWER 4.0 software package and the 9-bus 3-generator power system defined by Western System Coordinating Council, the agent-based models are built and run under the uniform price auction rule and locational marginal pricing mechanism. Each generation company could learn from its past experience and improves its day-ahead strategic offers by using Variant Roth–Erev reinforcement learning algorithm. The results clearly demonstrate that improving wind forecasting accuracy helps increase the net earnings of the wind generation company. Also, the wind generation company can further increase its net earnings with the adoption of learning algorithm. Besides, it is verified that increasing wind penetration level within the investigation range can help reduce the market clearing price. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that agent-based simulation is a viable modeling tool which can provide realistic insights for the complex interactions among different market participants and various market factors.","Gong Li, Jing Shi",,Sascha,"Market Dynamics, Agent-Based Modelling",,248,Applied Energy

6/10/2012 16:34:32,Article,Sustainable Revenue Management: A Smart Cards Enabled Agent-Based Modeling Approach,"Public transportation operators (PTOs) function in an increasingly competitive environment that demands new approaches to revenue management for complex transportation networks. Revenue management is important for maximizing revenue growth and has commonly been performed by optimizing product availability and price levels. However, PTOs operate in a sensitive societal context that requires innovative approaches to revenue management. In this paper, we propose a new, sustainable perspective on revenue management that considers individual customers’ needs and requirements, environmental impacts, and PTO's financial viability. To demonstrate this perspective's efficacy, we developed a decision support tool using an agent-based modeling and simulation approach. The advantage of this microscopic method is its ability to capture the detailed operational and commercial aspects of transportation networks, as well as the heterogeneous consumer preferences relating to product price and service quality. We evaluated our modeling approach using real-world smart card transaction data collected from a major Dutch public transit authority. The results suggest that, by taking a customer-centric view and using an IT-enabled decision support system, PTOs can better explore the space of feasible solutions to find revenue management strategies that can lead to a sustainable situation.","Milan Lovric, Ting Li, Peter Vervest",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.061,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Market Dynamics, Agent-Based Modelling",,248,Decision Support Systems

This leads to the transformation of an ordinary n-player Prisoner's Dilemma of collective action into an n-player coordination game. The paper uses agent-based simulations to trace the formation of public goods while varying network characteristics, such as density, segregation, or the strength of relationships.

Our general framework is set in the context of an impending natural disaster, where individuals, represented by nodes on the network, must decide whether or not to evacuate. Sources of influence include a one-to-many externally driven global broadcast as well as pairwise interactions, across links in the network, in which agents transmit either continuous opinions or binary actions. We consider both uniform and variable threshold rules on the individual opinion as baseline models for decision-making. Our results indicate that 1) social networks lead to clustering and cohesive action among individuals, 2) binary information introduces high temporal variability and stagnation, and 3) information transmission over the network can either facilitate or hinder action adoption, depending on the influence of the global broadcast relative to the social network. Our framework highlights the essential role of local interactions between agents in predicting collective behavior of the population as a whole. ","Danielle S. Bassett, David L. Alderson, Jean M.

The dynamics of the epidemic is modeled using a stochastic compartmental epidemiological model with inhomogeneous mixing. The syndromic (typically non-medical) observations of the number of infected people (e.g. visits to pharmacies, sale of certain products, absenteeism from work/study, etc.) are assumed available for monitoring and prediction of the epidemic. The state of the epidemic, including the number of infected people and the unknown parameters of the model, are estimated via a particle filter. The numerical results indicate that the proposed framework can provide useful early prediction of the epidemic peak if the uncertainty in prior knowledge of model parameters is not excessive.","Alex Skvortso, Branko Ristic",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2012.05.010,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Complex Systems, Social Networks",,249,Mathematical Biosciences
6/24/2012 20:17:33,Article,Cultural evolution of a belief controlling human mate choice: Dynamic modeling of the hinoeuma superstition in Japan,"We develop a simple cultural dynamics model to dicuss the spread of the hinoeuma superstition in Japan. A large drop in the number of newborn babies observed in 1966 was attributed mainly to parents' avoiding having a child born in a hinoeuma year. Presumably, Japanese parents were afraid that a daughter born in 1966 (a hinoeuma year) might later have difficulty finding a mate. We construct mathematical models to examine whether the hinoeuma superstition would likely become extinct or be stably maintained in the population. We classify members of a population according to whether they believed the hinoeuma superstition (believer or nonbeliever), their gender (male or female), and their year of birth (born in a hinoeuma year or not). We compare several cases that differ according to (1) whether the belief in the superstition was transmitted to children by matrilineal, patrilineal, or Mendelian inheritance; (2) which parent controlled the timing of pregnancy and childbirth (maternal or paternal birth control); and (3) the probability of birth control failure. Our results show that the hinoeuma superstition is likely to spread if the mother has a strong influence on birth control and on the belief of their children. In contrast, if birth control is paternal and the belief is passed down from father to child, the hinoeuma superstition is likely to become extinct. In between these extremes, whether the superstition becomes extinct or fixed in the population depends on the initial frequency of believers in the population.","Cinthia Marie Tanaka, Yoh Iwasa",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.001,Sascha,"Societal Transitions, Complex Systems",,249,Journal of Theoretical Biology

The model takes into account internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles that are currently dominant in the market and electric vehicles (EVs) that are likely to enter the market in the future. The vehicles compete for market penetration through a vehicle choice algorithm that accounts for social influences and consumers' attractiveness for vehicle attributes. The main result provided by the modeling approach is the market share of different vehicles during the time period 2012–2030. The effects of fuel prices, vehicle taxes, future price of EVs and recharging concerns on the market share are analyzed with the help of the model. The results show that EVs would seize the market completely in the scenario combined of high gasoline price, decreasing EV price without tax and no worry about the recharging of EVs. The successful penetration of EVs in the scenarios with low gasoline price and combination of medium gasoline price and constant EV price needs policy supports like tax exemption and an environment where consumers do not suffer from range anxiety.","Ehsan Shafiei, Hedinn Thorkelsson, Eyjólfur Ingi Ásgeirsson, Brynhildur Davidsdottir, Marco Raberto and Hlynur Stefansson",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2012.05.011,Sascha,"Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues, Market Dynamics, Policy Making, Social Networks",,249,Technological Forecasting and Social Change
6/24/2012 20:31:46,Article,Formalizing the construction of populations in multi-agent simulations,"In individual-centered simulations, the variety and consistency of agents' behaviors reinforce the realism and validity of the simulation. Variety increases the diversity of behaviors that users meet during the simulation. Consistency ensures that these behaviors improve the users' feeling of immersion. In this work, we address the issue of the simultaneous influence of these two elements. We propose a formalization of the construction of populations for agent-based simulations, which provides the basis for a generic and non-intrusive tool allowing an out-of-the-agent design. First, the model uses behavioral patterns to describe standards of behaviors for the agents. They provide a behavioral archetype during agents' creation, and are also a compliance reference, that allows to detect deviant behaviors and address them. Then, a specific process instantiates the agents by using the specification provided by the patterns. Finally, inference enables to automate behavioral patterns configuration from real or simulated data. This formalization allows for the easy introduction of variety in agents' behaviors, while controlling the conformity to specifications. We applied the model to traffic simulation, in order to introduce driving styles specified using behavioral patterns (e.g. cautious or aggressive drivers). The behavioral realism of the traffic was therefore improved, and the experimentations we conducted show how the model contributes to increase the variety and the representativeness of the behaviors.","Benoit Lacroix, Philippe Mathieu, Andras Kemeny",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2012.05.011,Sascha,Agent-Based Modelling,,249,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence
6/24/2012 20:32:43,Article,Analysis of crime patterns through the integration of an agent-based model and a population microsimulation,"In recent years, criminologists have become interested in understanding crime variations at progressively finer spatial scales, right down to individual streets or even houses. To model at these fine spatial scales, and to better account for the dynamics of the crime system, agent-based models of crime are emerging. Generally, these have been more successful in representing the behaviour of criminals than their victims. In this paper it is suggested that individual representations of criminal behaviour can be enhanced by combining them with models of the criminal environment which are specified at a similar scale. In the case of burglary this means the identification of individual households as targets. We will show how this can be achieved using the complementary technique of microsimulation. The work is significant because it allows agent-based models of crime to be refined geographically (to allow, for example, individual households with varying wealth or occupancy measures) and leads to the identification of the characteristics of individual victims.","Nick Malleson, Mark Birkin",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2012.04.003,Sascha,Social Conflict and Social Simulation,,249,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems"

Such human activity patterns are often bursty, i.e., they consist of short periods of intense activity followed by long periods of silence. This burstiness has been shown to affect spreading phenomena; it accelerates epidemic spreading in some cases and slows it down in other cases. We investigate a model of history-dependent contagion. In our model, repeated interactions between susceptible and infected individuals in a short period of time is needed for a susceptible individual to contract infection. We carry out numerical simulations on real temporal network data to find that bursty activity patterns facilitate epidemic spreading in our model.

We then develop an efficient model parameter fitting technique and apply the model to the emergence of URL mentions in the Twitter network. Using a complete one month trace of Twitter we study how information reaches the nodes of the network. We quantify the external influences over time and describe how these influences affect the information adoption. We discover that the information tends to ""jump"" across the network, which can only be explained as an effect of an unobservable external influence on the network. We find that only about 71% of the information volume in Twitter can be attributed to network diffusion, and the remaining 29% is due to external events and factors outside the network. ","Seth A.

6/25/2012 12:33:37,Article,Understanding agent-based models of financial markets: A bottom-up approach based on order parameters and phase diagrams,"We describe a bottom-up framework, based on the identification of appropriate order parameters and determination of phase diagrams, for understanding progressively refined agent-based models and simulations of financial markets. We illustrate this framework by starting with a deterministic toy model, whereby N independent traders buy and sell M stocks through an order book that acts as a clearing house. The price of a stock increases whenever it is bought and decreases whenever it is sold. Price changes are updated by the order book before the next transaction takes place. In this deterministic model, all traders based their buy decisions on a call utility function, and all their sell decisions on a put utility function. We then make the agent-based model more realistic, by either having a fraction fb of traders buy a random stock on offer, or a fraction fs of traders sell a random stock in their portfolio. Based on our simulations, we find that it is possible to identify useful order parameters from the steady-state price distributions of all three models. Using these order parameters as a guide, we find three phases: (i) the dead market; (ii) the boom market; and (iii) the jammed market in the the phase diagram of the deterministic model. Comparing the phase diagrams of the stochastic models against that of the deterministic model, we realize that the primary effect of stochasticity is to eliminate the dead market phase.","Ribin Lye, James Peng Lung Tan, Siew Ann Cheong",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2012.06.014,Sascha,Market Dynamics,,249,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications

Our model relaxes that heroic assumption of one unique “true value” and deals with the formation of share market prices through the dynamic formation of individual and social opinions (or beliefs) based upon a fundamental signal of economic performance and position of the firm, the forecast revision by heterogeneous individual investors, and their social mood or sentiment about the ongoing state of the market pricing process. Market clearing price formation is then featured by individual and group dynamics that make its collective dimension irreducible to its individual level. This dynamic holistic approach can be applied to better understand the market exuberance generated by the Share Exchange over time.","Yuri Biondi, Pierpaolo Giannoccolo, Serge Galam",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2012.06.015,Sascha,Market Dynamics,,249,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications

It is generally assumed that there exists no simple ultimatum strategy whereby one player can enforce a unilateral claim to an unfair share of rewards. Here, we show that such strategies unexpectedly do exist. In particular, a player X who is witting of these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y’s score, independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player, an evolutionary player’s best response is to accede to the extortion. Only a player with a theory of mind about his opponent can do better, in which case Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma is an Ultimatum Game. ",William H. Press and Freeman J.

If punishment actions are detached from contribution and participation in the game, the combination of punishment and voluntary participation no longer leads to high levels of cooperation. We show that this result crucially depends on specific details of the role of those who abstain from the collective endeavour, and only holds for a small subset of assumptions. If these loners are truly alone, cooperators who punish only defectors prevail, even when antisocial punishment is available.","Julián García, Arne Traulsen",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.05.011,Sascha,Game Theory,,249,Journal of Theoretical Biology

We argue that one possible remedy is to learn to use data sets as modules and integrate them into the models. Then the data that are available for module calibration can serve as an intermediate linkage tool, sitting between modules and providing a module-independent baseline dynamics, which is then incremented when scenarios are to be run. In this case it is not the model output that is directed into the next model input, but model output is presented as a variation around the baseline trajectory, and it is this variation that is then fed into the next module down the chain. However still with growing overall complexity, calibration can become an important limiting factor, giving more promise to the integral approach, when the system is modeled and simplified as a whole.","Alexey Voinova, Herman H.

I develop a general model of success-biased social learning for discrete cultural traits with stochastic payoffs, and investigate its dynamics when only two variants are present. I find that success bias inherently favors rare variants, and consequently performs worse than unbiased imitation (i.e. random copying) when success payoffs are at least mildly stochastic and the optimal variant is common. Because of this weakness, success bias fails to replace unbiased imitation in an evolutionary model when selection is fairly weak or when the environment is relatively stable, and sometimes fails to invade at all. I briefly discuss the optimal strength of success bias, the complicated nature of defining success in social learning contexts, and the value of variant frequency as an important source of information to social learners. I conclude with predictions regarding the prevalence of success bias in different behavioral domains.",Ryan Baldini,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2012.06.005,Sascha,"Societal Transitions, Complex Systems",,250,Theoretical Population Biology

The paper presents a knowledge-based and distributed framework that simulates the behaviour of an irrigation system and permits accurate determination of irrigation timing. Several agents, which represent the actors involved in this problem, coordinate their activities in order to evaluate different irrigation strategies. A common ontology shares the knowledge required in the agent-based framework, which can be tuned according to the particular circumstances of the field. The usefulness of the developed system is demonstrated in three case studies, in which the simulations performed by the system provide the answer to different questions (length of irrigation time, comparison of a fixed and a dynamic irrigation policy, and most efficient configuration of a garden). The system simulates the behaviour of the irrigation system for the possible solutions and finds the most efficient one in terms of water consumption. Although only at small areal scale, this paper shows how agent-based simulation techniques can be successfully used to solve agricultural problems.","David Isern, Sònia Abelló, Antonio Moreno",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2012.04.007,Sascha,Spatial and Ecological-Economic issues,,250,

The large majority of recent modeling approaches are connectivity driven. The structural patterns of the network are at the basis of the mechanisms ruling the network formation. Connectivity driven models necessarily provide a time-aggregated representation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating dynamics of many networks. We address this challenge by defining the activity potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions and constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous time description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of structural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from the heterogeneous activity of agents. Within this framework, highly dynamical networks can be described analytically, allowing a quantitative discussion of the biases induced by the time-aggregated representations in the analysis of dynamical processes.","N.

But this book argues that this does not place it beyond the reach of a science that can help to explain and perhaps even to predict social behaviour. As a system made up of many interacting agents – people, groups, institutions and governments, as well as physical and technological structures such as roads and computer networks – society can be regarded as a complex system. In recent years, scientists have made great progress in understanding how such complex systems operate, ranging from animal populations to earthquakes and weather. These systems show behaviours that cannot be predicted or intuited by focusing on the individual components, but which emerge spontaneously as a consequence of their interactions: they are said to be ‘self-organized’. Attempts to direct or manage such emergent properties generally reveal that ‘top-down’ approaches, which try to dictate a particular outcome, are ineffectual, and that what is needed instead is a ‘bottom-up’ approach that aims to guide self-organization towards desirable states. This book shows how some of these ideas from the science of complexity can be applied to the study and management of social phenomena, including traffic flow, economic markets, opinion formation and the growth and structure of cities.",Philip Ball,,Sascha,"Policy Making, Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Societal Transitions",,250,Springer

By viewing the ABM dynamics as a micro-description of the process, we show how the corresponding macro-description is obtained by a projection construction. Then, well known conditions for lumpability make it possible to establish the cases where the macro model is still Markov. In this case we obtain a complete picture of the dynamics including the transient stage, the most interesting phase in applications. For such a purpose a crucial role is played by the type of probability distribution used to implement the stochastic part of the model which defines the updating rule and governs the dynamics. In addition, we show how restrictions in communication leading to the co-existence of different opinions correspond to the emergence of new absorbing states. We describe our analysis in detail with some specific models of opinion dynamics. Generalizations concerning different opinion representations as well as opinion models with other interaction mechanisms are also discussed. With their obvious limitations, the models do not allow for a direct generalization to more realistic cases, their treatment is only the first step in the stochastic analysis of the micro–macro link in social simulation. We find that our method may be an attractive alternative to mean-field approaches and that this approach provides new perspectives on the modeling of opinion exchange dynamics, and more generally of other ABM.","Sven Banisch, Ricardo Lima, Tanya Araújo",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2012.06.001,Sascha,"Agent-Based Modelling, Complex Systems, Social Networks",,251,Social Networks

Here, we analyze records of civil unrest of 170 countries during the period 1919-2008. We demonstrate that the distributions of the number of unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder between geographic regions connected through social and communication networks.

This question is even more difficult to answer than the long-standing question, what are the forces that keep our world together. However, the social challenges of humanity in the 21st century ranging from the financial crises to the impacts of globalization, require us to make fast progress in our understanding of how society works, and how our future can be managed in a resilient and sustainable way. This book can present only a few very first steps towards this ambitious goal. However, based on simple models of social interactions, one can already gain some surprising insights into the social, ``macro-level'' outcomes and dynamics that is implied by individual, ``micro-level'' interactions. Depending on the nature of these interactions, they may imply the spontaneous formation of social conventions or the birth of social cooperation, but also their sudden breakdown. This can end in deadly crowd disasters or tragedies of the commons (such as financial crises or environmental destruction). Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical modeling approaches (such as representative agent models) do not provide a sufficient understanding of the self-organization in social systems resulting from individual interactions. The consideration of randomness, spatial or network interdependencies, and nonlinear feedback effects turns out to be crucial to get fundamental insights into how social patterns and dynamics emerge. Given the explanation of sometimes counter-intuitive phenomena resulting from these features and their combination, our evolutionary modeling approach appears to be powerful and insightful.[...]",Dirk Helbing (Editor),,Sascha,"Complex Systems, Social Networks",,251,Springer

This book applies network science to contemporary social policy problems. In the first part, tools of diffusion and team design are deployed to challenges in adoption of ideas and the management of creativity. Ideas, unlike information, are generated and adopted in networks of personal ties. Chapters in the second part tackle problems of power and malfeasance in political and business organizations, where mechanisms in accessing and controlling informal networks often outweigh formal processes. The third part uses ideas from biology and physics to understand global economic and financial crises, ecological depletion and challenges to energy security. Ideal for researchers and policy makers involved in social network analysis, business strategy and economic policy, it deals with issues ranging from what makes public advisories effective to how networks influence excessive executive compensation.","Edited by Balázs Vedres, Central European University, Budapest, and Marco Scotti, Università degli Studi di Trento, Italy",http://www.cambridge.org/hu/knowledge/isbn/item6796397,Richard,"Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,254,Academic and Professional Books
9/27/2012 19:42:06,Article, The role for simulations in theory construction for the social sciences: Case studies concerning Divergent Modes of Religiosity,"Religion is, at the very least, a highly complex social phenomenon. The theories we use to understand religion – and sociocultural systems more generally – are often so complex that even experts in the field may not be able to see all their consequences. Social simulations can help us understand and communicate the consequences of a theory, provided we can describe the theory with sufficient precision and comprehensiveness in order to run it on a computer. In this article we demonstrate the benefits of simulating the predictions of a well-known theory in the Cognitive Science of Religion, the theory of Divergent Modes of Religiosity. Many of these predictions have already been tested against contemporary and longitudinal evidence, using the methods of both qualitative case study and large-scale survey, and some of the mechanisms responsible for the patterns observed have been investigated by means of controlled experiments. Nevertheless, in simulating the patterns of religious transmission and transformation predicted by the modes theory we discovered numerous aspects that were underspecified, generating new hypotheses for investigation in future empirical research. This back-and-forth between simulation and theory testing has the potential to accelerate progress in the scientific study of religion.","Harvey Whitehouse, Ken Kahn, Michael E.

Action selection is the task of doing the right thing at the right time. It requires the assessment of available alternatives, executing those most appropriate, and resolving conflicts among competing goals and possibilities. Using advanced computational modelling, this book explores cutting-edge research into action selection in nature from a wide range of disciplines, from neuroscience to behavioural ecology, and even political science. It delivers new insights into both detailed and systems-level attributes of natural intelligence and demonstrates advances in methodological practice. Contributions from leading researchers cover issues including whether biological action selection is optimal, neural substrates for action selection in the vertebrate brain, perceptual selection in decision making, and interactions between group and individual action selection. This first integrated review of action selection in nature contains a balance of review and original research material, consolidating current knowledge into a valuable reference for researchers while illustrating potential paths for future studies.

Complexity theory identifies instability and disorder in politics and policy making, and links them to the behaviour of complex systems. It suggests that we shift our analysis from individual parts of a political system to the system as a whole; as a network of elements that interact and combine to produce systemic behaviour. This article explores the use of complexity theory in public policy, highlighting a small literature using the language of complexity directly to describe complex policy-making systems, and a larger literature identifying complexity themes. It then highlights the main problems to be overcome before complexity theory can become truly valuable in politics and policy making.","Cairney, Paul",,Ozge,"Policy Making, Complex Systems",,257,POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW

However, no quantitative model to date allows us to validate competing theories of whether the emergence of scientific disciplines drives or follows the formation of social communities of scholars. Here we propose an agent-based model based on a \emph{social dynamics of science,} in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by the social interactions among scientists. We find that such a social theory can account for a number of stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, authors, and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science. A ""science of science"" must gauge the role of exogenous events, such as scientific discoveries and technological advances, against this purely social baseline.","Xiaoling Sun, Jasleen Kaur, Stasa Milojevic, Alessandro Flammini, Filippo Menczer",http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4950,Richard,"Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Agent-Based Modelling, Game Theory",SOCNET,257,Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Digital Libraries (cs.DL); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)

financial market, networks play a central role in nature and society.
Phenomena such as climate change, pandemics, and financial crises are
based on networked structures; and networks give insights into how
social environments affect health and behaviour. In this Very Short
Introduction, Guido Caldarelli and Michele Catanzaro discuss the
nature and variety of networks, using familiar examples from society,
technology, nature, and history. They show how networks self-organize
and the role they play in processes like large-scale blackouts and
computer virus outbreaks. They also describe the wide and important
applications of network theory in a range of areas, including
genetics, ecology, technology, and management.","G. Caldarelli, M.

We then assess the internal and external validity of experiments performed using MTurk, employing a framework that can be used to evaluate other subject pools. We first investigate the characteristics of samples drawn from the MTurk population. We show that respondents recruited in this manner are often more representative of the U.S. population than in-person convenience samples—the modal sample in published experimental political science—but less representative than subjects in Internet-based panels or national probability samples. Finally, we replicate important published experimental work using MTurk samples.","Adam J. Berinsky, Gregory A. Huber, and Gabriel S.

primary axis of global conflict was no longer ideological or economic

the ""battle lines of the future"". In contrast to the ""top down""
approach in previous research focused on the relations among nation
states, we focused on the flows of interpersonal communication
as a bottom-up view of international alignments. To that end,
we mapped the locations of the world's countries in global email
networks to see if we could detect cultural fault lines. Using IP geolocation on a worldwide anonymized dataset obtained from a
large Internet company, we constructed a global email network. In
computing email flows we employ a novel rescaling procedure to
account for differences due to uneven adoption of a particular Internet
service across the world. Our analysis shows that email flows
are consistent with Huntington's thesis. In addition to location in
Huntington's ""civilizations"", our results also attest to the importance
of both cultural and economic factors in the patterning of
inter-country communication ties.","Bogdan State, Patrick Park, Ingmar Weber, Yelena Mejova, Michael Macy",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.0045v1.pdf,Richard,"Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General, Game Theory, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,262,arXiv

We modelled peer review as a process based on knowledge asymmetries and subject to evaluation bias. We built various simulation scenarios in which we tested different interaction conditions and author and referee behaviour. We found that reciprocity cannot always have per se a positive effect on the quality of peer review, as it may tend to increase evaluation bias. It can have a positive effect only when reciprocity motives are inspired by disinterested standards of fairness.","Flaminio Squazzoni and Claudio Gandelli

4/21/2013 12:54:14,Article,Pattern-oriented modeling for land change ABMs,"“Local land-use and -cover changes (LUCCs) are the result of both the decisions and actions of individual land-users, and the larger global and regional economic, political, cultural, and environmental contexts in which land-use systems are embedded. However, the dearth of detailed empirical data and knowledge of the influences of global/regional forces on local land-use decisions is a substantial challenge to formulating multi-scale agent-based models (ABMs) of land change. Pattern-oriented modeling (POM) is a means to cope with such process and parameter uncertainty, and to design process-based land change models despite a lack of detailed process knowledge or empirical data. POM was applied to a simplified agent-based model of LUCC to design and test model relationships linking global market influence to agents’ land-use decisions within an example test site. Results demonstrated that evaluating alternative model parameterizations based on their ability to simultaneously reproduce target patterns led to more realistic land-use outcomes. This framework is promising as an agent-based virtual laboratory to test hypotheses of how and under what conditions driving forces of land change differ from a generalized model representation depending on the particular land-use system and location.","Nicholas R.

4/21/2013 17:56:35,Article,Crawling big data in a new frontier for socioeconomic research: testing with social tagging,"Tags and keywords, freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offer a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflect the users’ interests and preferences, as well as automatically generate folksonomies. Social tagging systems have gained increasing popularity as a method for annotating and categorizing a wide range of different web resources. They also attract researchers in social sciences because they offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology and findings for further research are discussed.","Borrero, J.D. and Gualda, E.",http://ideas.repec.org/p/ris/cieodp/2013_007.html,Richard,"Agent-Based Modelling, Methods in General, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,263, Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics - Discussion Papers

6/12/2013 15:13:03,Book,Simulating Social Complexity - a handbook,"Simulating Social Complexity examines all aspects of using agent- or individual-based simulation. This approach represents systems as individual elements having each their own set of differing states and internal processes. The interactions between elements in the simulation represent interactions in the target systems. What makes these elements ""social"" is that they are usefully interpretable as interacting elements of an observed society. In this, the focus is on human society, but can be extended to include social animals or artificial agents where such work enhances our understanding of human society.

 The phenomena of interest then result (emerge) from the dynamics of the interaction of social actors in an essential way and are usually not easily simplifiable by, for example, considering only representative actors.

 The introduction of accessible agent-based modelling allows the representation of social complexity in a more natural and direct manner than previous techniques. In particular, it is no longer necessary to distort a model with the introduction of overly strong assumptions simply in order to obtain analytic tractability. This makes agent-based modelling relatively accessible to a range of scientists. The outcomes of such models can be displayed and animated in ways that also make them more interpretable by experts and stakeholders.

 This handbook is intended to help in the process of maturation of this new field. It brings together, through the collaborative effort of many leading researchers, summaries of the best thinking and practice in this area and constitutes a reference point for standards against which future methodological advances are judged.

 This book will help those entering into the field to avoid ""reinventing the wheel"" each time, but it will also help those already in the field by providing accessible overviews of current thought. The material is divided into four sections: Introductory, Methodology, Mechanisms, and Applications. Each chapter starts with a very brief section called ‘Why read this chapter?’ followed by an abstract, which summarizes the content of the chapter. Each chapter also ends with a section of ‘Further Reading’ briefly describing three to eight items that a newcomer might read next.

Affect Control Theory presents a maximum likelihood solution in which optimal behaviours or identities can be predicted based on past interactions. Here, we formulate a probabilistic and decision theoretic model of the same underlying principles, and show this to be a generalisation of the basic theory. The model is more expressive than the original theory, as it can maintain multiple hypotheses about behaviours and identities simultaneously as a probability distribution. This allows the model to generate affectively believable interactions with people by learning about their identity and predicting their behaviours. We demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our model can be used as an emotional “plug-in” for systems that interact with humans.

The main novelties of the model are the introduction of a ""behavioral filter approach"" to model tax decisions, the combination of a set of different mechanisms to produce tax compliance (namely rational choice, normative commitments and social influence), and the use of the concept of ""fraud opportunity use rate"" (FOUR) as the main behavioral outcome. After describing the model in detail, we display the main behavioral and economic results of 1,920 simulations calibrated for the Spanish case and designed to test for the internal validity of SIMULFIS. The behavioral outcomes show that scenarios with strict rational agents strongly overestimate tax evasion, while the introduction of social influence and normative commitments allows to generate more plausible compliance levels under certain deterrence conditions. Interestingly, the relative effect of social influence is shown to be ambivalent: it optimizes compliance under low and middle deterrence conditions, but not when deterrence is made harder.","Toni LLACER, Franciso J.

12/22/2013 11:50:12,Article,Going Viral,"We live in a world where a tweet can be instantly retweeted and read by millions around the world in minutes, where a video forwarded to friends can destroy a political career in hours, and where an unknown man or woman can become an international celebrity overnight. Virality: individuals create it, governments fear it, companies would die for it.

In this important new book Nahon and Hemsley uncover the factors that make things go viral online. They analyze the characteristics of networks that shape virality, including the crucial role of gatekeepers who control the flow of information. They also explore the role of human attention, showing how word of mouth, bandwagon effects, homophily, and interest networks help to explain the patterns of individual behavior that make viral events.

Drawing on a wide range of examples, this path-breaking account of viral events will be essential reading for students, scholars, politicians, policymakers, executives, artists, and anyone who wants to understand how our world today is being shaped by the flow of information online.",Karine Nahon and Jeff Hemsley,http://ekarine.org/goingviral/,Richard,"Policy Making, Social Conflict and Social Simulation, Societal Transitions, Methods in General, Game Theory, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,267,
12/22/2013 12:18:53,Article,Using Pattern-oriented Modeling (POM) to Cope with Uncertainty in Multi-scale Agent-based Models of Land Change,"Local land-use and -cover changes (LUCCs) are the result of both the decisions and actions of individual land-users, and the larger global and regional economic, political, cultural, and environmental contexts in which land-use systems are embedded. However, the dearth of detailed empirical data and knowledge of the influences of global/regional forces on local land-use decisions is a substantial challenge to formulating multi-scale agent-based models (ABMs) of land change. Pattern-oriented modeling (POM) is a means to cope with such process and parameter uncertainty, and to design process-based land change models despite a lack of detailed process knowledge or empirical data. POM was applied to a simplified agent-based model of LUCC to design and test model relationships linking global market influence to agents’ land-use decisions within an example test site. Results demonstrated that evaluating alternative model parameterizations based on their ability to simultaneously reproduce target patterns led to more realistic land-use outcomes. This framework is promising as an agent-based virtual laboratory to test hypotheses of how and under what conditions driving forces of land change differ from a generalized model representation depending on the particular land-use system and location.","Nicholas R.

3/13/2014 20:48:16,Article,Can Synergy in Triple-Helix Relations Be Quantified? A Review of the Development of the Triple-Helix Indicator,"Triple-Helix arrangements of bi- and trilateral relations can be considered as adaptive eco-systems. During the last decade, we have further developed a Triple-Helix indicator of synergy as reduction of uncertainty in niches that can be shaped among three or more distributions. Reduction of uncertainty can be generated in correlations among distributions of relations, but this (next-order) effect can be counterbalanced by uncertainty generated in the relations. We first explain the indicator, and then review possible results when this indicator is applied to (i) co-author networks of academic, industrial, and governmental authors and (ii) synergies in the distributions of firms over geographical addresses, technological classes, and industrial-size classes for a number of nations. Co-variation is then considered as a measure of relationship. The balance between globalizing and localizing dynamics can be quantified. Too much synergy locally can also be considered as lock-in. Tendencies are different for the globalizing knowledge dynamics versus locally retaining wealth from knowledge in industrial innovations.","Loet Leydesdorff, Han Woo Park",http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2377307,Richard,"Methods in General, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,268,SSRN
3/13/2014 20:50:47,Article,"Geographic and Technological Perspectives on ""Photovoltaic Cells:"" Patents as Instruments for Exploring Innovation Dynamics","The dynamics of innovation are nonlinear and complex: geographical, technological, and economic selection environments can be expected to interact. Can patents provide an analytical lens to this process in terms of different attributes such as inventor addresses, classification codes, backward and forward citations, etc.? Two recently developed patent maps with interactive overlay techniques--Google Maps and maps based on citation relations among International Patent Classifications (IPC)--are elaborated into dynamic versions that allow for online animations and comparisons by using split screens. Various forms of animation are explored. The recently developed Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPC) of the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) provide new options for a precise delineation of samples in both USPTO data and the worldwide patent database PatStat of EPO. Among the ""technologies for the mitigation of climate change"" (class Y02), we zoom in on nine material technologies for photovoltaic cells; and focus on one of them (CuInSe2) as a lead case. The longitudinal development of Rao-Stirling diversity in the IPC-based maps provides a heuristics for studying technological generations during the period under study (1975-2012). The sequencing of generations prevails in USPTO data more than in PatStat data because PatStat aggregates patent information from countries in different stages of technological development, whereas one can expect USPTO patents to be competitive at the technological edge.","Loet Leydesdorff, Floortje Alkemade, Gaston Heimeriks, Rinke Hoekstra",http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2778,Richard,"Methods in General, Complex Systems, Social Networks",SOCNET,268,arXiv
5/17/2014 9:38:15,Article,Can web presence predict academic performance? The case of Eötvös university,"This paper reports the preliminary results of a project that aims at incorporating the analysis of the web presence (content) of research institutions into the scientometric analysis of these research institutions. The problem is to understand and predict the dynamics of academic activity and resource allocation using web presence. The present paper approaches this problem in two parts. First we develop a crawler and an archive of the web contents obtained from academic institutions, and present an early analysis of the records. Second, we use (currently off-line records to analyze the dynamics of resource allocation. Combination of the two parts is an ambition of ongoing work. The motivation in this study is twofold. First, we strongly believe that independent archiving, indexing and searching of (past) web content is an important task, even with regards to academic web presence. We are particularly interested in studying the dynamics of the ""online scientific discourse"", based on the assumption that the changing traces of web presence is an important factor that documents the intensity of activity. Second, we maintain that the trend-analysis of scientific activity represents a hitherto unused potential. We illustrate this by a pilot where, using 'offline' longitudinal datasets, we study whether past (i.e. cumulative) success can predict current (and future) activity in academia. Or, in short: do institutions invest and publish in areas where they have been successful? Answer to this question is, we believe, important to understanding and predicting research policies and their changes.","László Gulyás, Zsolt Jurányi, Sándor Soós, George Kampis",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2579037,Richard,"System Dynamics, Methods in General, Complex Systems, Social Networks",RessearcherGate,269,Proceedings of the companion publication of the 23rd international conference on World wide web companion

NetLogo is a free software platform for implementing individual-based and agent-based models. However, NetLogo’s support of systematic design, performance and analysis of simulation experiments is limited. The statistics software R includes such support.

 2. RNetLogo is an R package that links R and NetLogo: any NetLogo program can be controlled and run from R and model results can be transferred back to R for statistical analyses. RNetLogo includes 16 functions, which are explained and demonstrated in the user manual and tutorial. The design of RNetLogo was inspired by a similar link between Mathematica and NetLogo.

 3. RNetLogo is a powerful tool for making individual-based modelling more efficient and less ad hoc.
